Abstract = {{Building information modeling (BIM) is considered as a vital technology
   to achieve building sustain ability in China. Many local companies have
   developed BIM assisting tools to accelerate the transformation of the
   Architecture, Engineering, Construction (AEC) industry. The industry
   believed the use of BIM tools would increase the informatization.
   However, no investigations have been made to evaluate the status of the
   tools providing BIM service in China. This study reviewed the typical
   features of BIM tools in China and illustrated the workflows of some
   representative tools. The common tools were counted. The different
   building projects where the tools were used and common functions of
   these tools were summarized. An assessment of their performances based
   on eleven criteria was conducted after the illustrations. The review of
   the tools finds that BIM software can be classified into three types,
   integrated platforms, instant service services, and supplementary works
   based on the workflow illustrations. The collaboration of these three
   types would contribute to cleaner production. The assessment revealed
   that the aspects where these tools played a role in improving
   engineering efficiency and what areas were needed to be improved. Three
   suggestions and three potential schemes of BIM tools in construction
   projects are discussed at the end. Developers need to further explore
   the cloud data usages, and thus, collaborations of different tools can
   be promoted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the
   improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social
   support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been
   demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS)
   has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of
   neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the
   impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic
   exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study
   proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 +/- 5.7 years) with MCI
   (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 +/- 3.4) were randomly
   assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or
   control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a
   neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and
   urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental
   period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention
   was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency
   towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and
   visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a
   greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and
   verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing
   within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of
   subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight
   heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily
   Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance
   in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After
   training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in
   significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group.
   Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are
   promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in
   support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies
   on larger scale samples of patients are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The endovascular technique has led to a revolution in the care of
   patients with vascular disease; however, acquiring and maintaining

   Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology allows the production of

   Different 3D printing methods are compared, describing their advantages,
   disadvantages and potential roles in surgical training. The process of
   3D printing a vascular model based on an imaging examination consists of
   the following steps: image acquisition, image post-processing, 3D
   printing and printed model post-processing. The entire process can take
   a week. Prospective studies have shown that 3D printing can improve

Abstract = {{The existing automatic control program and its parameters for three
   machines in a fully mechanized Coal Mining face are static and simplex
   and are therefore inadequate for satisfying the complex and dynamic
   environment of underground coal mines. To overcome this problem, a
   collaborative mathematical model is established that includes the
   effects of a dynamic environment. A virtual reality collaborative
   planning simulator with methods for the three machines is also proposed
   based on a multi-agent system. According to the dynamic characteristics
   of the environment, equipment, and technologies, a fully mechanized
   Unity3D simulator (FMUnitySim) is designed in terms of multiple factors
   and multiple dimensions. The factors affecting the coordinated operation
   of the three machines are analyzed and modeled. The communication modes,
   coordination, and redundant sensing process among multiple agents, which
   include the shearer agent and the scraper conveyor agent, are also
   investigated in detail. Using this system, the key parameters of the
   three machines can be planned and adjusted online to design and
   distinctly observe the corresponding collaborative simulations of
   coordinated operation with multiple perspectives and in real time. Tests
   of different maximum shearer haulage speeds for regular or reverse
   transporting coal are designed; their key parameters, including the
   average shearer haulage speed, average follower distance, and average
   scraper conveyor load, are planned and simulated using FMUnitySim. The
   optimal parameter combination is obtained by analyzing and comparing the
   simulation results. The proposed FMUnitySim offers an effective means
   and theoretical basis for the rapid planning and safe automatic
   production of a fully mechanized Coal Mining face.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Although two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional videos
   have traditionally provided foundations for reviewing operative
   procedures, the recent 360 degrees format may provide new dimensions to
   surgical education. This study sought to describe the production of a
   high quality 360 degrees video for an index-operation (augmented with
   educational material), while evaluating for variances in attentiveness,
   information retention, and appraisal compared to 2D.
   DESIGN: A 6-camera synchronised array (GoPro Omni, {[}California, United
   States]) was suspended inverted and recorded an elective laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy in 2016. A single-blinded randomised cross-over study
   was performed to evaluate this video in 360 degrees vs 2D formats. Group
   A experienced the 360 degrees video using Samsung (Suwon, South-Korea)
   GearVR virtual-reality headsets, followed by the 2D experience on a
   75-inch television. Group B were reversed. Each video was probed at
   designated time points for engagement levels and task-unrelated images
   or thoughts. Alternating question banks were administered following each
   video experience. Feedback was obtained via a short survey at study
   completion.
   SETTING: The New Academic and Education Building (NAEB) in Dublin, Royal
   College of Surgeons in Ireland, July 2017.
   PARTICIPANTS: Preclinical undergraduate students from a medical
   university in Ireland.
   RESULTS: Forty students participated with a mean age of 23.2 +/- 4.5
   years and equal sex involvement. The 360 degrees video demonstrated
   significantly higher engagement (p < 0.01) throughout the experience and
   lower task unrelated images or thoughts (p < 0.01). Significant
   variances in information retention between the 2 groups were absent (p =
   0.143) but most (65\%) reported the 360 degrees video as their learning
   platform of choice. Mean appraisal levels for the 360 degrees platform
   were positive with mean responses of > 8/10 for the platform for
   learning, immersion, and entertainment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the successful development and
   evaluation of a 360 degrees operative video. This new video format
   demonstrated significant engagement and attentiveness benefits compared
   to traditional 2D formats. This requires further evaluation in the field
   of technology enhanced learning. (C) 2017 Association of Program

Abstract = {{Entrepreneurial activity of transition countries, such as the RS and
   BiH, is filled with many threats from the environment, particularly
   concerning the lack of adequate entrepreneurial education, institutional
   support as well as the communication infrastructure between them and
   their significant financial impotence. The potential of SME
   entrepreneurship represents a significant precondition in the
   development of the national economy as well as the prerequisite of
   prevention and / or exit from the economic crisis, provided that their
   potential is exploited by a planned, not uncontrolled approach.
   Maximizing of market potential and resource capabilities requires the
   establishment of an adequate decision-making system where problems are
   solved through planning, selection, application and measuring of the
   systemic environment from the aspect of significance, while at the same
   time, taking into account the internal potentialities.
   Adequate communication between decision-makers with theoretical models
   and their effective implementation in business planning enables business
   systems and SME to achieve maximum business efficiency and effectiveness
   through the optimal combination of their own potential and business
   environment.
   The theoretical model is a virtual tool which is used for symbolic -
   quantitative description of the real system, where the degree of
   conformity of the model and the reality which we described in it, is the
   determining factor in the success of real application of the modeled
   information.
   The control problem is solved only by an adequate theoretical model that
   covers, selects, quantifies and functionally linked internal and
   external factors of ``treated{''} reality. Functional linking of factors
   in the applied model must be adapted to decision-making conditions,
   which concerns the conditions of certainty, uncertainty or risk. The
   classification of decision makers should go into the direction of
   recognizing input, random and output variables as well as detecting the
   conditions and forms of their interdependence, adapted to
   decision-making conditions.
   The business system is a goal-oriented system that requires optimization
   at several different levels to achieve system optimal as an adequate
   synergic suboptimal resultant.
   The proposed approach is related to the stochastic optimization of the
   product portfolio harmonized with market potential, and after that the
   deterministic optimization of production processes in the function of
   achieving the optimal production portfolio.
   The payment matrix as a virtual aid, or a brief summary of possible
   business results, allows the choice of optimal business strategy with
   maximum approval of model-based prediction and real business results.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes and synthesizes the existing literature relevant
   to pedestrian receptivity toward Fully Automated Vehicles (FAVs).
   Objectives of this review are to identify research gaps that need to be
   filled and to propose a roadmap for future research. Since FAVs are
   operated by software and hardware, with no human driver required,
   interactions between other road users and FAVs must be understood, and
   potential risks must be addressed. This is especially true for
   pedestrians, who often exhibit unpredictable behavior and are one of the
   most vulnerable road-user groups. A comprehensive review was conducted
   of 1) different aspects of pedestrian interaction with forthcoming fully
   automated vehicles, and 2) the existing research approaches ( surveys
   and simulator studies) for investigating risky pedestrian behavior as
   well as public acceptance of fully automated vehicles. The review
   identified three major gaps in pedestrian research: 1) lack of a
   pedestrian behavior questionnaire for FAV research, 2) lack of a
   validated pedestrian simulator for FAV research, and 3) lack of research
   investigating pedestrian design suggestions for FAVs. A future research
   roadmap to facilitate investigating pedestrian receptivity toward FAVs
   was designed. Achieving pedestrian acceptance of FAVs will require
   investigation of pedestrian risks and needs by transportation
   researchers and communication of the results to vehicle manufacturers
   and regulatory agencies. This review will be useful to transportation
   researchers and automated vehicle manufacturers to help guide planning
   for future design and production of FAVs in order to ensure their
   successful implementation.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: As the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more
   widespread, additional risk related to the learning curve can be
   expected. This article reports the results of a Delphi process to define
   procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to
   promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as, for
   example, lung cancer and thymoma surgery.
   METHODS: In June 2016, a working panel was spontaneously created by
   members of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) and European
   Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) with a specialist
   interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. An
   e-consensus-finding exercise using the Delphi methodology was applied
   requiring 80\% agreement to reach consensus on each question. Repeated
   iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds.
   RESULTS: Agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic
   training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into
   clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway; the basic robotic
   curriculum should include a baseline evaluation, an e-learning module, a
   simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation, Dry lab
   and Wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. Advanced
   robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right
   upper lobe) with video demonstration, access to video library of robotic
   procedures, simulation training, modular console training to index
   procedure, transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and
   final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent
   examiners.
   CONCLUSIONS: Agreement was reached on a large number of questions to
   optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in
   robotic activity. The production of the content of the learning material
   is ongoing.}},

   employed that provides visual feedback to check the interference between

   increasing number of experiences use multiple camera locations. In such
   multi-view 360 degrees media (MV360M) systems, a visual effect is
   required when the user transitions from one camera location to another.
   This effect can take several forms, such as a cut or an image-based
   warp, and the choice of effect may impact many aspects of the
   experience, including issues related to enjoyment and scene
   understanding. To investigate the effect of transition types on
   immersive MV360M experiences, a repeated-measures experiment was
   conducted with 31 participants. Wearing a head-mounted display,
   participants explored four static scenes, for which multiple 360 degrees
   images and a reconstructed 3D model were available. Three transition
   types were examined: teleport, a linear move through a 3D model of the
   scene, and an image-based transition using a Mobius transformation. The
   metrics investigated included spatial awareness, users' movement
   profiles, transition preference and the subjective feeling of moving
   through the space. Results indicate that there was no significant
   difference between transition types in terms of spatial awareness, while
   significant differences were found for users' movement profiles, with
   participants taking 1.6 seconds longer to select their next location
   following a teleport transition. The model and Mobius transitions were
   significantly better in terms of creating the feeling of moving through
   the space. Preference was also significantly different, with model and
   teleport transitions being preferred over Mobius transitions. Our
   results indicate that trade-offs between transitions will require
   content creators to think carefully about what aspects they consider to
   be most important when producing MV360M experiences.}},

Abstract = {{In today's dynamic manufacturing environments, the adoption of virtual
   reality (VR)-based simulation technologies to help in product and
   process design activities is becoming more widespread. With the onset of
   the next IT-oriented revolution involving global cyber manufacturing
   practices, the recent emergence of Internet of things (IoT)-related
   technologies holds significant promise in ushering an era of seamless
   information exchange which will provide a robust foundation for the next
   generation of smart manufacturing frameworks dependent on cyber physical
   system (CPS)-based principles, approaches, and technologies. In this
   paper, we present a broad framework for IoT-based collaborations
   involving the adoption of VR-based analysis environments networked with
   other cyber physical components. The process context for this
   VR-centered approach is electronics assembly, which involves the
   assembly of printed circuit boards. In such manufacturing contexts, it
   is essential to have a seamless flow of data/information among the
   various cyber physical components to ensure an agile collaborative
   strategy which can accommodate changing customer needs. VR-based
   simulation environments play a key role in this framework which supports
   multiple users collaborating using haptic interfaces and next-generation
   network technologies. The simulation outcomes and production data from
   physical shop floors can be compared and analyzed using this IoT
   framework and approach.}},

Abstract = {{Digital twin technology is considered as a key technology to realize
   cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the complexity of building
   a digital equivalent in virtual space to its physical counterpart, very
   little progress has been achieved in digital twin application,
   especially in the complex product assembly shop-floor. In this paper, we
   propose a framework of digital twin-based smart production management
   and control approach for complex product assembly shop-floors. Four core
   techniques embodied in the framework are illustrated in detail as
   follows: (1) real-time acquisition, organization, and management of the
   physical assembly shop-floor data, (2) construction of the assembly
   shop-floor digital twin, (3) digital twin and big data-driven prediction
   of the assembly shop-floor, and (4) digital twin-based assembly
   shop-floor production management and control service. To elaborate how
   to apply the proposed approach to reality, we present detailed
   implementation process of the proposed digital twin-based smart
   production management and control approach in a satellite assembly
   shop-floor scenario. Meanwhile, the future work to completely fulfill
   digital twin-based smart production management and control concept for
   complex product assembly shop-floors are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article proposes a cooperatively analytic solving method that
   calculates the chute posture in the bending section. The method
   maintains a good posture of the scraper conveyor during its bending
   process and solves the feeding trajectory of the shearer accurately and
   precisely. This method modifies and perfects the existing method to
   obtain the main parameters of the bending section, including the
   postures of the chutes and pin rails, and the corresponding extension
   lengths of the advancing units. A virtual-reality software that can
   visually simulate this entire operation process under different
   conditions is developed. Considering the gap between the driving wheel
   and the pin rails, the relationship between the shearer yaw angle and
   shearer working trajectory in the feeding stage is investigated for
   different body lengths. The angular relationship between the left and
   right driving wheels and the pin rails is also researched. Finally, the
   proposal is verified in experiments on a test prototype and on physical
   equipment. This analytic method provides a theoretical basis for the
   cooperative three-dimension localization of three machines in a fully

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{When we touch an object, complex frictional forces are produced, aiding
   us in perceiving surface features that help to identify the object at
   hand, and also facilitating grasping and manipulation. However, even
   during controlled tactile exploration, sliding friction forces fluctuate
   greatly, and it is unclear how they relate to the surface topography or
   mechanics of contact with the finger. We investigated the sliding
   contact between the finger and different relief surfaces, using
   high-speed video and force measurements. Informed by these experiments,
   we developed a friction force model that accounts for surface shape and
   contact mechanical effects, and is able to predict sliding friction
   forces for different surfaces and exploration speeds. We also observed
   that local regions of disconnection between the finger and surface
   develop near high relief features, due to the stiffness of the finger
   tissues. Every tested surface had regions that were never contacted by
   the finger; we refer to these as ``tactile blind spots{''}. The results
   elucidate friction force production during tactile exploration, may aid
   efforts to connect sensory and motor function of the hand to properties
   of touched objects, and provide crucial knowledge to inform the
   rendering of realistic experiences of touch contact in virtual reality.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Today's virtual reality (VR) restricts the screenwriter with its
   technological shortcomings, and there is little agreement on how stories
   should be told in the new format. While its immersivity heightens the
   audience's sense of presence, and perhaps accentuates empathy, it draws
   attention away from plot and information, favouring mood and emotion.
   While the narrative VR of the mid-2010s favoured first-person
   point-of-view (POV) protagonists, what we must consider is how, as
   technological advances grant audiences ever-greater agency, traditional
   storytelling collapses when said audiences can take autonomous action
   and affect the plot. A disembodied third-person POV, as in regular
   cinema, is also unlikely to satisfy audiences. This paper argues that
   second-person POV, where the viewer is the protagonist's sidekick, is
   the device that will allow future VR audiences to fully immerse and
   interact without giving up our perennial pleasures of plot, character
   arc and leaning back while others do the work. In the 2020s, narrative
   VR's economies of production are also likely, through an uberization of
   filmmaking, to dramatically change the industry and the role of the

Abstract = {{New technologies such as product simulators and virtual reality now
   allow firms to provide realistic product usage experiences and reduce

   should view product design and investments to reduce buyer uncertainty

   information buyers can obtain from third-party infomediaries. We
   introduce a game-theoretic model of a competitive market where both
   quality production and quality disclosure are endogenous decisions,
   affected by information made available by third parties. We show that
   quality investment under uncertainty never exceeds the level of quality
   investment under perfect information. Furthermore, we show that
   information availability by third parties allows firms to free ride, and
   it especially favors lower quality firms, who can reduce their
   information disclosure investments more so than higherquality firms.
   Finally, we show that the intuitive argument that firms must improve
   their product quality when overall information availability in the
   market improves does not always hold. Instead, improved information
   availability may enable firms to reduce their quality in some

Abstract = {{Visualization of simulated crop growth and development is of significant

   phenomenon of organs cross-drawing by developing a method of collision
   detection for improving vivid 3D visualizations of virtual wheat crops.
   First, the triangular data of leaves are generated with the tessellation
   of non-uniform rational B-splines surfaces. Second, the bounding volumes
   (BVs) and bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) of leaves are constructed
   based on the leaf morphological characteristics and the collision
   detection of two leaves are performed using the Separating Axis Theorem.
   Third, the detecting effect of the above method is compared with the
   methods of traditional BVHs, Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) tree, and
   Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) tree. Finally, the BVs of other organs (ear,
   stem, and leaf sheath) in virtual wheat plant are constructed based on
   their geometric morphology, and the collision detections are conducted
   at the organ, individual and population scales. The results indicate
   that the collision detection method developed in this study can

   In theorizing a more comprehensive approach to augmented reality, we
   draw upon Wiley's (2005. Spatial materialism: Grossberg's Deleuzean

   Deleuzian spatial materialism that emphasizes the imbrication of local

Abstract = {{The usage of holographic virtual customer inspections for gathering
   feedback during the production in the aviation industry was successfully

   progress to enclose early phases in New Product Development throughout
   the manufacturing. Consequently, collaboration achievement is targeted
   here by the virtual inspection of digital mock-ups, semi-/ and finished
   products to enable the circulation of knowledge and exhibiting design
   iterations in set based models. Nevertheless, challenges are associated
   to the virtual inspection, which are derived from technological
   constraints or based on the nature of distant collaboration. An
   assessment of these challenges is made by means of a hierarchical
   aggregation to discuss conceptually the applicability of the extension,
   highlighting future research areas for this field as well.}},

Title = {{3D Printing and its Effect on Outsourcing: A Study of the Indian
   Aircraft Industry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Indian Aircraft Industry has emerged as one of the rapid growing
   industrial endeavors in the world, with automation in most of its
   production and manufacturing areas. Technological advancements have led
   to this growth and, over the years, competitiveness has made the
   industry to efficiently look for avenues and other strategic alliances.
   In this direction, 3D printing technology has opened many opportunities.
   This study is focused on explaining the 3D printing technology
   utilization for production and servicing apart from developing a
   methodology to outsource various automated technologies to the
   tier-2/tier-3 companies basing themselves on specified parameters and
   capabilities by using the 3D printing. 3D printing in manufacturing
   industry, particularly in aircraft manufacture, has brought in novel
   prospective along with new challenges posturing new methodologies and
   innovative approaches to meet the global standards. In this line, the
   Indian Aircraft Industry has started redistributing its sourcing by
   outsourcing of certain non-strategic facilities and parts that can be
   manufactured with the use of 3D printing/additive manufacturing,
   computerization and automation to outsiders, aiming at development of
   capabilities in the partnership industry, to provide the scope for
   generating high volume at the affiliated industries to pave way for a
   win-win ground. Already playing a good role in aircraft engine
   manufacture at Indian aircraft industry, 3D printing is going to play a
   more vital role in the total aircraft manufacture and avionics in the
   next few years, if the present scenario is pragmatic in line with the
   industrial needs. With the advantage of ``low or zero{''} waste, less
   impact on environment, apart from possibility of local manufacture and
   just-in-time delivery, with greater specification of the final product,
   outsourcing of the parts and products for the entire aircraft
   manufacture will be a reality as per the current research, thriving on
   improved production volumes of similar parts for various end users.
   Research further suggests that outsourcing configuration is looking to
   invest in the new methods and ``timely production{''} would become an
   assurance with 3D printing.}},

Abstract = {{The main problem of the exploration and production sector in the oil and
   gas industry worldwide, and especially in Ecuador, lies in the extreme
   environmental conditions inherent to each oilfield, which makes it
   difficult to perform daily tasks of maintenance or equipment
   verification. Due to these harsh environments, this industry has seen
   the need to implement bilateral tele-operation systems with a high
   degree of scalability that allows the interaction between equipment and
   trained personnel that could safely perform maintenance activities. In
   order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to select a
   standardized messaging protocol that meets the current needs of the
   Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and allows the efficient use of
   communication channels bandwidth. This paper presents the design of a
   bilateral tele-operation system that allows the operator to carry out
   maintenance or remote inspection activities in the Well-Pads located in
   Petroamazonas EP, Ecuador. For the development of this system, the MQTT
   protocol is selected over other IIoT protocols because of its high speed
   of response in real time as well as its low consumption of resources. In
   the local site a virtual reality environment developed in a 3D graphic
   engine is implemented. Through input devices an infinite transparency is
   obtained, besides transmitting the experience and skills of the operator
   to the slave through the senses of sight, hearing, and kinesthesis. (C)

Title = {{Delivering word retrieval therapies for people with aphasia in a virtual
   communication environment}},
Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1054-1074}},
Abstract = {{Background: Delivering therapy remotely, via digital technology, can
   enhance provision for people with aphasia. EVA Park is a multi-user
   virtual island that can be used for such delivery. The first EVA Park
   study showed that daily language stimulation delivered via the platform
   improved functional communication and was positively received by users.
   This paper reports two single case studies, evaluating its capacity to
   deliver targeted language interventions. The first employed therapy for
   noun retrieval, using cued picture naming and modified Sematic Feature
   Analysis. The second employed modified Verb Network Strengthening
   Treatment (VNeST).Aims: This study aimed to determine if treatment
   delivery was feasible in EVA Park, as assessed by participant
   compliance, treatment fidelity and participants' views. It explored the
   impact of the therapies on treated and untreated word production,
   connected speech and functional communication.Methods \& Procedures: Two
   participants with aphasia each received 20 sessions of individual
   therapy in EVA Park, delivered over 5weeks. Feasibility was assessed by
   measuring compliance with the therapy regime, recording and checking the
   fidelity of 20\% of treatment sessions, and using post-therapy
   interviews to explore participant views. Treatment outcomes were
   evaluated via repeated measures single case designs, in which
   assessments were administered twice before therapy, immediately post
   therapy and 5 weeks later. Outcome measures included Object Picture
   Naming (study 1), Sentence Elicitation Pictures (study 2), Naming 84
   items from the Object and Action Naming Battery (study 2), Narrative
   Production (Study 2), the Northwestern Assessment of Verb and Sentences:
   Argument Structure Production Test (Study 2) and Communication
   Activities of Daily Living - 2 (Study 1 and 2).Outcomes \& Results:
   Feasibility results were excellent. Both participants were fully
   compliant with the therapy regime. There was at least 90\% fidelity with
   the treatment protocols, and participant views were positive. Outcomes
   varied across the studies. The noun therapy significantly improved the
   naming of treated words, with good maintenance. Lexical gains were less
   evident on the Sentence Elicitation Pictures used in the VNeST study.
   Neither study demonstrated generalisation to untreated words, connected
   speech or functional communication.Conclusions: Two treatment
   approaches, designed for face-to-face delivery, could be delivered
   remotely in EVA Park. Outcomes for the noun treatment were comparable to
   previous evaluations. Comparisons with previous research were more
   challenging for VNeST, owing to differences in methodology. Further
   evaluations of other treatment approaches are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The architecture, engineering and construction industry has long dealt
   with problems such as schedule and budget overruns, quality and safety
   issues, and low productivity. Off-site construction, which is a hybrid
   of manufacturing and construction, has significant potential to address
   industry's endemic problems. However, off-site construction has been
   criticized for replicating the traditional subcontracting approach and
   therefore fragmented practice in the construction industry. The current
   research focuses on process integration and cross-training of
   multi-skilled resources as a solution to the aforementioned problem. To
   identify optimal process integration architectures for off-site
   construction, production data of three off-site manufacturers were
   analyzed by using a hybrid of fuzzy theory and the technique for order
   of preference by similarity to ideal solution. Findings reveal that
   process integration architectures transferring excess capacity from
   under-utilized to over-utilized resources in direct or indirect pathways
   are preferable in terms of satisfying decision criteria such as time and
   cost of cross-training, skill transferability, compliance with network
   logic, and safety considerations. The study contributes to the off-site
   construction literature by providing insight into dynamics of using
   multi-skilled resources. It also contributes to practice by developing a
   customizable and user-friendly framework for off-site production
   managers in order to identify the optimal process integration
   architecture in their own production scenarios.}},

   architecture is used for the modular organization of the product,
   product-service, and production system for the gathering, evaluation and
   management of feedback for product development perspectives. A mobile
   and wearable augmented reality system is used to virtually walk through
   the partially or fully manufactured product and to compare the status of
   the production with the product model to be produced. Change requests
   are captured as customer feedback. The knowledge thus acquired can be
   overlaid (augmented) on the real product, i.e. the aircraft. This
   approach is able to record the dynamic requirements of targeted
   customers. These changes can be carried out in the current version of
   the aircraft, and also incorporated into future versions. The
   implementation using case studies is presented for gathering feedback

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article focuses on some of the most crucial social and cultural
   consequences of information and communication technologies as an
   increasingly important element of educational practices in Russia.
   Digital technologies and their role in the contemporary culture are
   analyzed from a sociological and philosophical perspective. Designed to
   give the human mind more freedom, ``smart{''} devices and gadgets have
   moved beyond their functional limits. Today, they are one of the factors
   to form the mindset of younger generations. The article focuses on how
   key elements of educational practices have been changing under the
   influence of digitalization. The following aspects of these changes are
   analyzed: replacement of traditional text-based communication with
   multidimensional audio and video media; wide-spread mechanisms of
   knowledge acquisition at a superficial introductory level only; passive
   and speculative strategies of learning; simulative and theoretical
   self-development practices, commonly accepted and associated with
   non-differentiating between the real and the virtual worlds. The article
   is concerned with the consequences of the qualitative transformation of
   the major ways of data production, storage and transfer due to the rapid
   growth of information technologies. In the field of education, these
   processes are especially easy to notice and, sometimes, difficult to
   deal with. Teaching subjects that require concentration, extensive
   reading and memorizing is a challenge now. The article claims that the
   digital culture has superseded the traditional ``book culture{''} as a
   result of the ``digitalizing{''} of an individual's mental world. Linear
   printed texts have been increasingly replaced with multidimensional
   digital images. As a result, traditional forms of self-identification
   are becoming irrelevant. An individual can have a wide range of
   identities. It is known that computer technologies open a real

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{356-365}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Eukaryotic microalgae and prokaryotic cyanobacteria are globally the
   most important primary producers, forming the base of food web in
   aquatic ecosystems. As such, they are eaten by a huge diversity of
   protistan taxa (e.g., amoeba, flagellates and ciliates), as well as
   zooplanktonic and larger metazoan grazers. As in terrestrial
   agriculture, grazing has the potential to devastate the microalgal
   ``crop{''} and this has obvious implications to the commercial success
   of the developing microalgal industry. Whilst in conventional
   agriculture thousands of years of exploitation of a relatively small
   number of crop plants, has resulted in tools, knowledge and strategies
   that can manage this issue, in the case of microalgal mass culture this
   is relatively undeveloped. This review explores our current
   understanding of the issue and where further research is needed,
   focusing on the diversity of grazers and how microalgae under various
   environmental regimes and culture conditions avoid being annihilated. In
   addition, the implications of algal mass culture, where the objective is
   to maintain a virtual monoculture, are discussed in the context of how
   infection could be prevented/ minimised and if infection occurs, how
   this may be managed to prevent excessive losses in productivity or
   quality of the algal crop. The ultimate objective would be the
   development of robust methodologies for the early detection of
   ``infection{''} of microalgal mass-cultures. This would allow the timely
   implementation of best management practices to prevent/reduce, damage
   caused by grazing. In reality, whilst there will be areas of
   commonality, as in terrestrial agricultural crops, methods will be need
   to be specifically tailored for each algal taxon, cultivation system and
   location.}},

   from early education to digital afterlife}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{163-171}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Imagineering is a portmanteau combining the words imagination and
   engineering. The term, imagineering, was coined during the early 1940s.
   Since the new Millennium, imagineering has grown to the scale of a mass
   paradigm, because of the increasing scope and availability of automated
   engineering. Automated engineering is enabled by sophisticated software
   and artificial intelligence (AI) across the virtual-social-physical
   convergence (VSP) of consumer devices, desktop machines, and Web
   platforms. The combining of human imagination with automated engineering
   is enabling millions of vloggers, self-publishers and makers to
   imagineer at high speed and low cost. This mass imagineering can range
   from early education to digital afterlife. It involves makerspaces, fab
   labs, hackerspaces, as well as use of disparate devices, machines, and
   platforms ``in the wild{''}. In this paper, three principal
   contributions to the literature are provided. First, mass imagineering
   is described from early education to digital afterlife. Second, analysis
   of structure and agency in mass imagineering is provided. This reveals
   that individual agency varies in different settings for mass
   imagineering, but is always more than in mass production and mass
   customization settings. Third, division of labour analysis of mass
   imagineering is provided. This reveals that mass imagineering extends
   labour outside of paid employment, such as in the home, towards greater
   self-expression and increased entrepreneurship. This is possible because
   of increasing automated engineering across VSP enabled by devices,
   machines, and platforms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TIME \& SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Recent literature has explored the processes of global change associated
   with the social relations, technologies, and economies of time, as well
   as the move from clock time to event time and network time. Others have
   focused on the presence bleed' evident in technologically-mediated work.
   A harried pace of life is exacerbated in what Judy Wajcman calls an
   acceleration society'. She points to how technologies can change the
   nature of current practices as well as create new ones. This article
   critically examines discourses of internet addiction', by considering
   the phenomenon of internet use in the context of societal shifts in
   temporal relations. Drawing on a recent qualitative study of four adult
   heavy internet users, the analysis employs Bourdieu's theory of practice
   and notions of flow to explain the understandings and performance of
   temporality in the lives of so-called internet addicts'. The data
   illustrate complex multiple realities and multifaceted behaviours that
   comprise current social use of the internet and subsequent digital
   pathologies'. The article argues that the individual pathology model of
   internet addiction is not useful given the dramatic changes in
   temporality produced by digital technology. It suggests that the
   assumptions about the correct use of time embedded in notions of
   addiction reproduce binary distinctions between the real and the
   virtual, production and consumption and work and play which no longer
   reflect social practice. While it is certainly the case that users can
   be troubled by their inability to control their online activities, these
   experiences need to be understood within the specific social contexts of
   users' lives rather than being interpreted through a universal and
   medicalised model of addiction.}},

Title = {{Using game authoring platforms to develop screen-based simulated
   functional assessments in persons with executive dysfunction following
   traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{71-84}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The assessment of functional status is a critical component of clinical
   neuropsychological evaluations used for both diagnostic and therapeutic
   purposes in patients with cognitive brain disorders. There are, however,
   no widely adopted neuropsychological tests that are both ecologically
   valid and easily administered in daily clinical practice. This
   discrepancy is a roadblock to the widespread adoption of functional
   assessments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using a serious
   game authoring platform (eAdventure) for creating screen-based simulated
   functional assessments. We created a naturalistic functional task that
   consisted of preparing a cup of tea (SBS-COT) and applied the assessment
   in a convenience sample of eight dyads of therapists/patients with mild
   executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury. We had three main
   aims. First, we performed a comprehensive review of executive function
   assessment in activities of daily living. Second, we were interested in
   measuring the feasibility of this technology with respect to staffing,
   economic and technical requirements. Third, a serious game was
   administered to patients to study the feasibility of this technology in
   the clinical context (pre-screening test). In addition, quantitative
   (Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires) and qualitative
   (semistructured interviews) evaluations were applied to obtain user
   input. Our results suggest that the staffing, economic and technical
   requirements of the SBS-COT are feasible. The outcomes of the
   pre-screening test provide evidence that this technology is useful in
   the functional assessment of patients with executive dysfunction. In
   relation to subjective data, the TAM questionnaire showed good user
   acceptability from a professional perspective. Interview analyses with
   professionals and patients showed positive experiences related to the
   use of the SBS-COT. Our work indicates that the use of these types of
   authoring platforms could have positive long-term implications for
   neuropsychological research, opening the door to more reproducible,
   cooperative and efficient research by allowing the facilitated
   production, reuse and sharing of neuropsychological assessment tools.

   Phasic Muscle Activity during Goal-Directed Reaching}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Human reaching movements require complex muscle activations to produce
   the forces necessary to move the limb in a controlled manner. How
   gravity and the complex kinetic properties of the limb contribute to the
   generation of the muscle activation pattern by the central nervous
   system (CNS) is a long-standing and controversial question in
   neuroscience. To tackle this issue, muscle activity is often subdivided
   into static and phasic components. The former corresponds to posture
   maintenance and transitions between postures. The latter corresponds to
   active movement production and the compensation for the kinetic
   properties of the limb. In the present study, we improved the
   methodology for this subdivision of muscle activity into static and
   phasic components by relating them to joint torques. Ten healthy
   subjects pointed in virtual reality to visual targets arranged to create
   a standard center-out reaching task in three dimensions. Muscle activity
   and motion capture data were synchronously collected during the
   movements. The motion capture data were used to calculate postural and
   dynamic components of active muscle torques using a dynamic model of the
   arm with 5 degrees of freedom. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was
   then applied to muscle activity and the torque components, separately,
   to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Muscle activity was also
   reconstructed from gravitational and dynamic torque components. Results
   show that the postural and dynamic components of muscle torque represent
   a significant amount of variance in muscle activity. This method could
   be used to define static and phasic components of muscle activity using
   muscle torques.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Simulation is now firmly established in modern surgical
   training and is applicable not only to acquiring surgical skills but
   also to non-surgical skills and professionalism. A 5-day intensive
   Urology Simulation Boot Camp was run to teach emergency procedural
   skills, clinical reasoning, and communication skills using clinical
   scenario simulations, endoscopic and laparoscopic trainers. This paper
   reports the educational value of this first urology boot camp.
   Subjects and methods: Sixteen urology UK trainees completed pre-course
   questionnaires on their operative experience and confidence level in
   common urological procedures. The course included seven modules covering
   basic scrotal procedures, laparoscopic skills, ureteroscopy,
   transurethral resection of the prostate and bladder tumour, green light
   laser prostatectomy, familiarisation with common endoscopic equipment,
   bladder washout to remove clots, bladder botox injection, setting up
   urodynamics. Emergency urological conditions were managed using
   scenarios on SimMan (R). The main focus of the course was handson
   training using animal models, bench-top models and virtual reality
   simulators. Post-course assessment and feedback on the course structure
   and utility of knowledge gained together with a global outcome score was
   collected.
   Results: Overall all the sections of feedback received score of over
   4.5/5, with the hands-on training on simulators getting the best score
   4.8/5. When trainees were asked ``The training has equipped me with
   enhanced knowledge, understanding and skills,{''} the average score was
   4.9/5.0. The vast majority of participants felt they would recommend the
   boot camp to future junior trainees.
   Conclusion: This first UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp has demonstrated
   feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing trainee's experience. Given
   these positive feedbacks there is a good reason to expect that future
   courses will improve the overall skills of a new urology trainee. (C)

Abstract = {{Spatial treatment of diegetic sound in virtual reality (VR) is generally

Abstract = {{People's mental representations of their own body are malleable and
   continuously updated through sensory cues. Altering one's
   body-representation can lead to changes in object perception and
   implicit attitudes. Virtual reality has been used to embody adults in
   the body of a 4-year-old child or a scaled-down adult body. Child
   embodiment was found to cause an overestimation of object sizes,
   approximately double that during adult embodiment, and identification of
   the self with child-like attributes. Here we tested the contribution of
   auditory cues related to one's own voice to these visually-driven
   effects. In a 2 x 2 factorial design, visual and auditory feedback on
   one's own body were varied across conditions, which included embodiment
   in a child or scaled-down adult body, and real (undistorted) or
   child-like voice feedback. The results replicated, in an older
   population, previous findings regarding size estimations and implicit
   attitudes. Further, although auditory cues were not found to enhance
   these effects, we show that the strength of the embodiment illusion
   depends on the child-like voice feedback being congruent or incongruent
   with the age of the virtual body. Results also showed the positive
   emotional impact of the illusion of owning a child's body, opening up
   possibilities for health applications.}},

   Insoles}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{360-373}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many foot pathologies are prevented or treated with Custom Made Insoles
   (CMIs). Although a strong computerization has characterized the shoe
   development process during the last decade, the CMI sector still lacks a
   software platform integrating the design and diagnosis tools used by the
   stakeholders of this area. Moreover, the prescription of CMIs is only
   based on the experience of skilled podiatrists rather than on a common
   and shared knowledge (e.g. guidelines, best practices, rules, etc.).
   This paper presents a multi-users and knowledge-based platform, called
   Smart Prescription Platform (SPP), covering the whole CMI development
   phases, from foot diagnosis to the production, involving clinicians,
   patients, manufacturers and controllers. The web-based platform is fully
   integrated with the technologies available in the orthopaedic sector,
   which are 3D/4D scanners, baropodometric platforms, footwear virtual
   catalogues, plantar pressure simulators, Augmented Reality devices and
   3D CAD systems. The use of standard file formats (e.g..stl,.bmp,.xml)
   allows an electronic dataflow among the tools. The main module of the
   platform, called Prescription System (PS), is used for prescribing
   custom-made insoles for patients with different health conditions,
   satisfying the needs of all actors and optimizing the data exchange. PS
   is a knowledge-based prescription system integrating the best practices
   related to the prescription of CMIs. The PS output is a XML file
   representing the electronic order, used to exchange data with the other
   tools of the SPP.
   The proposed platform has been tested with a twofold aim: to validate
   the usability of the Prescription System and the inter-operability of
   the platform tools. The positive results gathered during the validation,
   led the experts to start using the web platform for their daily work.

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) training technology in the mining industry is a new
   field of research and utilization. The successful application of VR
   training system is critical to mine safety and production. Through the
   statistics of the current research and applications of VR training
   systems in mining industry, all the input/output devices are classified.
   Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used
   in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining
   industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type,
   projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based
   intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap
   motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype
   for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried
   both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control
   system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show
   that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is
   easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system,
   namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given
   more attention in future research. With more available technologies of
   input and output devices, VR engines, and system software, the VR
   training system will eventually yield much better training results, and
   will play a more important role in as a training tool for mine safety.

Abstract = {{Augmented reality emerges as a tool, on which it is necessary to examine
   its real educational value. This paper shows the results of a
   bibliometric analysis performed on documents collected from the Web of
   Science repository, an Internet service that concentrates bibliographic
   information from more than 7,000 institutions. Our analysis included an
   overall universe of 12,000 indexed journals and 148,000 conference
   proceedings. From those, we selected a sample targeting the terms
   ``mobile-learning{''} or ``m-learning{''} and ``augmented reality{''} as
   descriptors or components of titles of scientific works. The analysis on
   journals (n=741) and in conference proceedings (n= 913) reveals a
   differentiated perspective in each area in the last two years. A
   qualitative analysis of 67 scientific productions addressing these
   subjects complements the research. This highlights five themes:
   conceptualization of the phenomenon, development of new methodologies,
   motivation, spatial delocalization, and implementation in subject-matter
   areas. The research highlights logical changes, such as greater and
   differentiated access to information; transcendent innovations, such as
   increasing informal and ludic activities, insertion into virtual
   environments, membership of specific groups, and networks of friendly
   interaction, along creation of new scales of values. These elements are
   now beginning to constitute fundamental parts of teaching methodologies.
   Education appears to be subsidiary to technical advances, thus imposing
   a drastic methodological change.}},

Abstract = {{Much has been written about the function of narrative in virtual reality
   (VR) productions (Aylett \& Louchart, 2003; Aylett et al, 2005; Ryan,

   degree of control that they have over the content, has led some scholars
   to believe that there is an ontological problem with describing VR in
   narrative terms. This article investigates some of these assumptions,
   via an analysis of an undertheorised aspect of VR that has emerged in
   recent years - the 360 degrees film. It argues that 360 degrees film
   represents a much more important aspect of VR than has been previously
   recognised. In so doing, the article establishes this medium as an
   important field of study, and argues that ultimately, it will be the
   commercial infrastructure for this content which will define the

Abstract = {{The ``Speculations on Anonymous Materials{''} exhibition, curated by
   Susanne Pfeffer and held from September 2013 to February 2014 at the
   Fridericianum de Kassel Museum is the starting point for this text,
   which aims to address some aspects that I consider to be crucial in
   respect of art and speculative futures. With more than 50 artworks by 25
   European and North American artists - most of them first-or
   second-generation children of immigrants - the exhibition demonstrated a
   new eclectic aesthetic that seems to interweave the Pop and
   Post-humanist, Post-Internet or Post-Digital styles, with different
   nuances that go from the abject to some form of contemporary futurism.
   The exhibition displayed a ``futurised{''} present (or a
   ``presentised{''} future), to which one can attribute some reflection
   about the ``hyper{''} and ``trans{''} aestheticization of the everyday
   life (Lipovetsky and Serroy) in the current consumerist, post-Fordist
   society, in particular in terms of its ultra-digitised artistic
   capitalism. Taking Speculative materialism and Speculative Realism
   (Meillassoux; Bryant; Harman) and \#ACCELERATE: Manifesto for an
   Accelerationalist Politics (Alex Williams; Nick Srnicek) as its starting
   point, this article will attempt to theoretically contextualise the
   exhibition and examine conceptually some of the participating artists,
   such as Timur Si-Qin, Pamela Rosenkranz, Katja Novitskova, Josh Kline
   and Ryan Trecartin, among others.
   These novel artists work with the material aspect of new digital and
   industrial technologies and of everyday objects (plastics, digital
   images, synthetic products, and so on) in works whose physical reality
   is conformed by subliminal digital processes, thereby evidencing the
   hyperreality in which we are submerged. Their works are born from a
   reaction to the complexity of contemporary capitalist society and to its
   everyday landscape, and they express the real and virtual environment in
   which the current and future generations seem destined to live. But
   above all the exhibition expresses, from the perspective of aesthetics
   and the theory of contemporary art, a change of onto-epistemological
   paradigm, which is a symptom of an evolution with respect to the
   paradigms in force until now.}},

Abstract = {{Computer animation of trees has widespread applications in the fields of
   film production, video games and virtual reality. Physics-based methods
   are feasible solutions to achieve good approximations of tree movements.
   However, realistically animating a specific tree in the real world
   remains a challenge since physics-based methods rely on dynamic
   properties that are difficult to measure. In this paper, we present a
   low-cost interactive approach to model and animate outdoor trees from
   photographs and videos, which can be captured using a smartphone or
   handheld camera. An interactive editing approach is proposed to
   reconstruct detailed branches from photographs by considering an
   epipolar constraint. To track the motions of branches and leaves, a
   semi-automatic tracking method is presented to allow the user to
   interactively correct mis-tracked features. Then, the physical
   parameters of branches and leaves are estimated using a fast Fourier
   transform, and these properties are applied to a simplified
   physics-based model to generate animations of trees with various
   external forces. We compare the animation results with reference videos
   on several examples and demonstrate that our approach can achieve
   realistic tree animation.}},

Abstract = {{To perform accurate hepatectomy without injury, it is necessary to
   understand the anatomical relationship among the branches of Glisson's
   sheath, hepatic veins, and tumor. In Japan, three-dimensional (3D)
   preoperative simulation for liver surgery is becoming increasingly
   common, and liver 3D modeling and 3D hepatectomy simulation by 3D
   analysis software for liver surgery have been covered by universal
   healthcare insurance since 2012. Herein, we review the history of
   virtual hepatectomy using computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and our
   research to date, and we discuss the future prospects of CAS. We have
   used the SYNAPSE VINCENT medical imaging system (Fujifilm Medical,
   Tokyo, Japan) for 3D visualization and virtual resection of the liver
   since 2010. We developed a novel fusion imaging technique combining 3D
   computed tomography (CT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The
   fusion image enables us to easily visualize anatomic relationships among
   the hepatic arteries, portal veins, bile duct, and tumor in the hepatic
   hilum. In 2013, we developed an original software, called Liversim,
   which enables real-time deformation of the liver using physical
   simulation, and a randomized control trial has recently been conducted
   to evaluate the use of Liversim and SYNAPSE VINCENT for preoperative
   simulation and planning. Furthermore, we developed a novel hollow
   3D-printed liver model whose surface is covered with frames. This model
   is useful for safe liver resection, has better visibility, and the
   production cost is reduced to one-third of a previous model.
   Preoperative simulation and navigation with CAS in liver resection are
   expected to help planning and conducting a surgery and surgical
   education. Thus, a novel CAS system will contribute to not only the
   performance of reliable hepatectomy but also to surgical education.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1990s, civil society organizations partnered with business to
   green global supply chains by setting up formal sustainability
   standard-setting organizations (SSOs) in sectors including organic food,
   fair trade, forestry, and fisheries. Although SSOs have withstood the
   long-standing allegations that they are unnecessary, costly,
   nondemocratic, and trade-distorting, they must now respond to a new
   challenge, arising from recent developments in technology. Conceived in
   the pre-Internet era, SSOs are discovering that verification systems
   that utilize annual, expert-led, low-tech field audits are under
   pressure from new information and communication technologies that
   collect, aggregate, interpret, and display open-source Big Data in
   almost real time. Drawing on the concept of governmentality and on
   interviews with experts in sustainability certification and natural
   capital accounting, we argue that while these technological developments
   offer many positive opportunities, they also enable competing
   alternatives to the prevailing truth or governing rationality about what
   is happening on the ground, which is of critical existential importance
   to SSOs as guarantors of trust in claims about sustainable production.
   While SSOs are not helpless in the face of this challenge, we conclude
   that they will need to do more than take incremental action: rather,
   they should respond actively to the disintermediation challenge from new
   virtual monitoring technologies if they are to remain relevant in the
   coming decade.}},

Abstract = {{Tactile sensors, most commonly referred as strain and pressure sensors,
   can collect mechanical property data of the human body and local
   environment, to provide valuable insights into the human health status
   or artificial intelligence systems. The introduction of a high level of
   wearability (bendability and stretchability) to tactile sensors can
   dramatically enhance their interfaces with the contact objects,
   providing chronically reliable functions. Therefore, the developed
   wearable tactile sensors are capable of conformably covering arbitrary
   curved surface over their stiff counterparts without incurring damage,
   emerging as a promising development direction toward the Internet of
   Things (IoT) applications. Fundamental parameters of the wearable
   tactile sensors such as sensitivity and stretchability have experienced
   unprecedented advancement, owing to the progress of device fabrication
   techniques and material structural engineering. Moreover, novel smart
   materials and mechanically durable sensor design concepts endow these
   sensors with multi-functionality integration (e.g., simultaneous force,
   temperature and humidity detection, simultaneous pressure and strain
   discrimination) and stirring properties (e.g., biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, self-healing, self-powering and visualization),
   further broadening the application scope of current wearable tactile
   sensors. Besides, it is desirable that a tactile sensor is compatible
   with a printing process that presents a new era of feasible wearable
   technology due to its large-area and high-throughput production
   capability. In addition to the development of sensors, packaging, and
   integration of the rest of the tactile device system (data memory,
   signal conversion, power supply, wireless transmission, feedback
   actuator, etc.) to build a wearable platform also emerge as major
   research frontiers in recent years. This review attempts to summarize
   the current state-of-the-art wearable tactile sensors concerning basic
   concepts, functional materials, sensing mechanism, promising
   applications, performance optimization strategies, multifunctional
   sensing, and system integration. Finally, the discussion will be
   presented regarding potential challenges, pathways, and opportunities.

Abstract = {{The extent to which you adapt your grammatical choices to match that of

   the interlocutor's behaviour and a clear dimension along which to
   manipulate social perceptions toward this interlocutor. Our results
   suggest an inverted U-shaped curve in structural priming magnitude for
   passives as a function of strangeness: the participants showed the
   largest priming effects for the intermediately strange, with a decrease
   when interacting with the least- or most-strange avatars. The
   relationship between social perception and priming magnitude may thus be
   non-linear. There seems to be a `happy medium' in strangeness, evoking
   the largest priming effect. We did not find a significant interaction of

   Stiegler, the author criticizes the confusion between Deleuze's concept
   of << event >> as a virtual production of sense and the modern theory of
   << augmented reality >>. In the last section of his paper, he explains
   his idea of << Con-temporaneity >> as a shared experience of common
   temporariness, and also suggests some possible developments of political
   philosophy beyond the tradition of the << history of concepts >>.}},

Abstract = {{There is no doubt that an abundance of factors exists that makes
   learning with serious games successful. Research articles reporting on
   these factors, however, tend to focus on select serious game elements
   and do not combine all salient factors for successful learning with
   serious games. Addressing this gap is a necessity for the success of
   serious games and may even alleviate long-standing debates about
   pedagogy over enjoyment, how much realism is enough or whether
   artificial intelligence is worth the cost. This article examines
   existing academic literature from 2000 to 2015, extracting shared
   serious game success factors that have had an encouraging impact on
   gameful learning experiences. As such, we subsequently aim to withdraw
   the field from a perpetual spiral of does-my-game-work research toward
   more worthwhile why-does-my-game-not-work research. Qualitative content
   analysis through the constant comparison method (CCM) analyzed a total
   of 63 articles from a variety of recognized electronic libraries and
   databases. Through this analysis, we reveal five central serious game
   themes: backstory and production; realism; artificial intelligence and
   adaptivity; interaction; and feedback and debriefing, all of which
   require deliberate intertwining with pedagogical content to ensure
   successful learning. This review unravels each of the five themes into
   their constituent factors and consequently presents the factors as
   practical guidelines that serious games producers should strive to
   include in their game productions. Applying these recommendations
   whenever serious games are considered will provide a foundation for
   effective gameful learning experiences.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the production of a digital environment to foster
   the learning of conics through augmented reality. The name conic refers
   to curves obtained by the intersection of a plane with a right circular
   conical surface. The environment gives students the opportunity to
   interact with the cone and the plane as virtual objects in real time and
   real place. They can perceive their own creation of the different
   curves: parabola, circle, ellipse and hyperbola. A dynamical animation
   to visualize the focus and directrix of the parabola is presented by
   introducing the Dandelin Spheres into the virtual environment. Besides
   the motivational element it offers, the purpose is to promote an active
   learning through the affordances of augmented reality technology.
   Anxiety towards mathematics could be tackled if students comprehend the
   mathematical knowledge. The integration of digital technology in the
   learning process helps this strengthening the development of spatial
   ability in students.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes gaze-based hand interaction, which is helpful for
   improving the user's immersion in the production process of virtual

   an experiment using a questionnaire. First, three-dimensional
   interactive content is produced for use in the proposed interaction
   experiment while presenting an experiential environment that gives users
   a high sense of immersion in the mobile virtual reality environment.
   This is designed to induce the tension and concentration of users in
   line with the immersive virtual reality environment. Additionally, a
   hand interaction method based on gaze-which is mainly used for the entry
   of mobile virtual reality content-is proposed as a design method for
   immersive mobile virtual reality environment. The user satisfaction
   level of the immersive environment provided by the proposed gaze-based
   hand interaction is analyzed through experiments in comparison with the
   general method that uses gaze only. Furthermore, detailed analysis is
   conducted by dividing the effects of the proposed interaction method on

Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{122-131}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a mathematical derivation was performed to prove that
   there are three characteristics of chirp signals, self-compression,
   cyclic shift and chirp rate orthogonality. Based on these three
   features, a new method is proposed to improve the spectrum efficiency by
   joining virtual time reversal together with an orthogonal carrier. The
   advantages of the method can be summarized as follows. (1) By using the
   self-compression feature of a chirp signal, it is easy to obtain the
   spread gain by increasing the production of the time and bandwidth,
   instead of designing a complex pseudo random code. (2) The bit rate can
   be improved by taking the cyclic-shift feature into account and
   designing the M-ary modulation for the chirp carrier. (3) Chirp carriers
   have a certain orthogonality if they are under the considered design,
   that is, it is possible to use multi-carriers to improve the bit rate
   and spectrum efficiency. (4) Furthermore, by using the VTRM (Virtual
   Time Reversal Mirror) technique, the ISI (Inter Symbol Interference) of
   the Chirp carrier can be decreased and the robustness can be increased.
   Simulations, pool and sea experiments verified its feasibility and
   performance. Outfield experiments demonstrated that the BER (Bit Error
   Rate) of the method can be stabilized at a magnitude of 10(-3) without
   the channel code, while the bit rate can reach 1 kbps by using a 2 kHz
   bandwidth. Thus, the spectrum efficiency can be over 0.5 bis/Hz and can
   be useful in reality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Penrose Studios is an animation studio that produces content for VR and

   facing animators and directors creating this type of content, such as
   animating without a fixed camera and very few cuts. Studios currently
   leverage existing animation and production tools to create content
   rendered in real time. However, this new medium is hampered by
   traditional processes that greatly reduce artist productivity and
   creativity. For instance, animating in traditional third party tools and
   importing into VR often leads to unexpected results, which results in a
   suboptimal iteration loop. We present a variety of tools that improve
   the traditional animation pipeline to address these issues and reduce
   the frequency of context switches between virtual reality and 2D
   monitors. The result is a toolset where artists feel empowered to
   explore animation in this new art form without being crippled by

Abstract = {{Here, live-action `cinematic-VR, (also referred to as `360 degrees
   video') is considered as a distinct hybrid technology, in that
   photographic image capture and processing methods are coupled with VR
   head mounted display (HMD) technologies.
   This study examines cVR for its necessary reformulation of embodiment
   (and disembodiment) regarding both author and viewer, as they engage
   with pro-filmic reality via the respective technical apparatuses. For
   the author, the distinctive cVR production pipeline requires a shift in
   the treatment of the filmed scenario and their bodily relation to it;
   for the viewer, established structures of engagement with conventional
   (frame-bound) linear video are disrupted through the cognitive insertion
   of their body into the cVR scene.
   With embodiment as its central thematic concern, this study will provide
   a theoretical grounding for nonfiction cVR in terms of its
   epistemological affordances and limitations as a technology. Following a
   critique of cVR as a yet unresolved theoretical hybrid (as engendering
   assumptions of both filmic and VR modes of representation), a mixed,
   primarily phenomenological study will be employed to gain insights into
   the nature of discourse in nonfiction cVR, and its reformulated dynamics
   between author and viewer.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of a set for a television production is a complex work;
   usually, several objects have to be manually placed in the environment
   and the configuration might be changed many times before finding the
   final set up. This configuration phase can be expensive and time
   consuming when large and heavy objects have to be moved. In order to
   tackle this issue, virtual sets allow the director of production to
   create virtual scenes before placing real objects. This paper proposes
   an alternative approach based on augmented reality technologies: objects
   of the scene are computer generated assets, which can be placed and
   manipulated in a real environment. With respect virtual sets, the
   proposed solution allows the director to move in a real scene enriched
   by computer-generated objects to be placed in the environment. The user
   wears an AR headset and manipulates objects by a tablet. The proposed
   system was evaluated by a group of 9 testers, which had to create an
   augmented TV set. Subjective and objective parameters have been used to
   assess the system usability.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of Head-Up-Displays (HUDs) have opened up avenues for a
   whole range of novel AR applications. However, until these applications
   become available for the mass market a number of problems need to be
   tackled. For example, the field of view (FoV) of current HUDs is
   extremely limited, and real world tracking and 3D reconstruction are
   still not precise enough to show driving information embedded into wide
   areas of complex traffic environment. It is not possible to show true
   AR-visualisations in the display areas provided by the current FoVs. In
   this paper, we investigate how an AR-like visualisation approach in
   current HUDs (with a limited FoV) can support drivers in foreseeing the
   future road course. This visualisation uses the already established
   concept of an electronic horizon. By complying with automotive
   standards, our application can be easily adapted for series production.
   With this visualisation we performed a user study, investigating the
   effect on drivers' gaze behaviour. For this reason the test subjects
   were equipped with an eye tracking system. The results showed a decrease
   in both, the number of gazes as well as total glance time on the head
   unit and the instrument cluster. We also investigated the test subjects'
   braking behaviour around sharp bends of the road which showed an overall
   improvement when the visualisation was enabled. Furthermore it showed an
   increase of the mean glance duration in the area of the HUD. Note that
   the eye tracking system is not capable of distinguishing between glances
   at the visualisation in the HUD and the users' glance at objects behind
   the visualisation -overlapping with the HUD. This would require tracking
   the test persons' depth of focus. The study showed that developers need
   to be concerned about not displaying excessively in the HUD, so as not
   to distract drivers. It furthermore showed that AR-like visualisations
   have the potential to decrease the time the driver is not looking at the
   road creating a safer driving experience.}},

Abstract = {{This article deals with the role of tabloids and tabloid information in
   children's lives. The goal of our research was the analysis of influence
   of tabloid information on the children in the age of 11 until 14 years
   old, together with the role of media education in family and school
   environment. Our results showed that children avoid the classical
   (printed) tabloid media. Children are really not interested in the
   scandals of celebrities usually consumed by mainstream readers of
   tabloids. Children heroes are mostly youtubers, popular people in the
   virtual reality and the main criterion of the information value is the
   number of sharing. They want to be online all the time. However through
   the social sites they consume the contents which meet the
   characteristics of tabloids. Our research indirectly showed that the
   world of current children and their close grown-ups, like parents and
   teachers, is divided. For parents and teachers there is then very
   difficult to watch those very simple videos that are so popular with
   their children. The problem lies not only in the quality, but also in
   the quantity of the production of these contents. The question is how
   this kind of permanent online world could negatively influence this
   generation in the future. (C) 2017 Published by Future Academy

Abstract = {{Nowadays the production of online resources for teaching is a proven
   reality that has been promoted by the universities through support and
   financial plans. This situation has led to the creation of multitude of
   videos and virtual laboratories. The main consequence: the large number
   of these online resources that have been repeated. In this regard, is it
   necessary to create online resources only because we have to follow the
   current trend? Do all the created resources have good quality? These
   questions and the problem that suffer the students to identify the best
   resource for learning, prompted GRIPAU (Interdisciplinary group for
   university learning) to start working on generic skills.
   From this reflection, two Projects of Innovation and improvement were
   born:
   1 ``How to incorporate generic skills in your daily work? On-line
   resources on innovative experiences for professors and students{''},
   whose objectives were: i) identify and select existing on-line materials
   on generic skills, ii) classify the materials according to the different
   skills and iii) Disseminate good teaching practices at the UPV.
   2 Innovative experiences in generic skills development using advanced
   ICT tools, whose main objective was to create an assessment template
   using a tool based on 3.0 environment for generic skills evaluation.
   Joining both projects, online resources have been used with students of
   degree, master and doctorate with the aim of facilitating the
   development of generic skills. In addition, this development and
   evaluation has been carried out through the use of a 3.0 environment to
   facilitate the work of the professor. Online resources were previously
   classified by the GRIPAU components within the Riunet institutional
   repository (www.riunet.upv.es). Each video was identified based on the
   generic skill that was exposed in the resource, the level of mastery
   (undergraduate, master or doctoral students) and the degree of
   interaction. From this database, the GRIPAU's professors chose the most
   appropriate online resources to work on their subjects, and uploaded
   them in the 3.0 environment. By this action, the student who did not
   know anything about this skill could be formed autonomously, and after
   that, develop the task. As a main result, the teachers valued very
   positively the reduction of the search time of resources prepared for
   generic skills development. In this way, the students corrected the lack
   of knowledge about the skill, improving their perception on this one.
   The differences between the initial perception about the level of
   acquired skill and the outcomes obtained after the task were more than
   40\%. As a main conclusion, it is necessary to improve this database and
   uses it, because we can find the best online resources necessaries to
   develop generic skills in our students.}},

Abstract = {{Factory layout planning is essential for manufacturing companies when
   designing or redesigning production systems. Layout planning usually
   involves 2D CAD applications, sometimes based on faulty data.
   Difficulties in communicating and discussing layout alternatives using
   such applications can lead to critical errors, yielding inaccurate
   simulation models producing poor results. This paper aims to investigate
   and evaluate the usefulness of realistic 3D layout models in the layout
   planning process, addressed by an industrial study of how existing
   methods for visualization can be applied. This paper shows that
   utilizing a realistic and accurate layout model allows for fruitful
   discussions while several potential mistakes can be avoided. It also
   shows benefits in evaluating a layout and the model's accuracy in
   immersive virtual reality where a better perspective of the layout can
   be acquired. Having such evaluated layout models will enable more
   accurate simulation models for planned changes, based on real physical
   requirements.}},

Pages = {{394-402}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective: The subjective visual vertical (SVV) is a
   measure of a subject's perceived verticality, and a sensitive test of
   vestibular dysfunction. Despite this, and consequent upon technical and
   logistical limitations, SVV has not entered mainstream clinical
   practice. The aim of the study was to develop a mobile virtual reality
   based system for SVV test, evaluate the suitability of different
   controllers and assess the system's usability in practical settings.
   Materials and methods: In this study, we describe a novel virtual
   reality based system that has been developed to test SVV using
   integrated software and hardware, and report normative values across
   healthy population. Participants wore a mobile virtual reality headset
   in order to observe a 3D stimulus presented across separate
   conditions-static, dynamic and an immersive real-world ({''}boat in the
   sea'') SVV tests. The virtual reality environment was controlled by the
   tester using a Bluetooth connected controllers. Participants controlled
   the movement of a vertical arrow using either a gesture control armband
   or a general-purpose gamepad, to indicate perceived verticality. We
   wanted to compare 2 different methods for object control in the system,
   determine normal values and compare them with literature data, to
   evaluate the developed system with the help of the system usability
   scale questionnaire and evaluate possible virtually induced dizziness
   with the help of subjective visual analog scale.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in SVV
   values during static, dynamic and virtual reality stimulus conditions,
   obtained using the two different controllers and the results are
   compared to those previously reported in the literature using
   alternative methodologies. The SUS scores for the system were high, with
   a median of 82.5 for the Myo controller and of 95.0 for the Gamepad
   controller, representing a statistically significant difference between
   the two controllers (P < 0.01). The median of virtual reality-induced
   dizziness for both devices was 0.7.
   Conclusions: The mobile virtual reality based system for implementation
   of subjective visual vertical test, is accurate and applicable in the
   clinical environment. The gamepad-based virtual object control method
   was preferred by the users. The tests were well tolerated with low
   dizziness scores in the majority of patients. (c) 2018 The Lithuanian

   effective nonverbal references. The first study involved an on-screen
   agent and the participant wearing eye-tracking glasses. The second study
   demonstrates that these positive outcomes can be achieved using
   head-pose estimation in place of full eye tracking. The third study

   we introduce saliency in order to weight detected artifacts according to
   the visual attention of end-users. Then, we propose different artifact
   detection and analysis methods for sharpness mismatch detection (SMD),
   color mismatch detection (CMD) and disparity distribution analysis. In
   particular, we took two state of the art approaches for SMD and CMD,
   which were originally developed for conventional planar images, and

Abstract = {{Nowadays the trends in manufacturing are aimed at exploding and using
   the full potential of production devices and systems. In this context,
   Simulation and VR tools play a key role in the evolution of such systems
   specially if used in conjunction. By using these tools, the present
   paper focused on the analyses of an iCIM 3000 system. The main goal of
   the paper lied on studying the possibilities of increasing the
   efficiency and effectivity of whole system and its individual devices.
   This was achieved by means of the creation of simulations and their
   comparison to the real system. At the same time, the results of the
   simulations themselves also became the basis for further and richer
   analyses by means of the use of VR tools that allowed a much deeper and
   detailed take of the whole system. The use of VR tools offered a better
   assessment and comprehension of the system under study what at the same
   time also worked as a feedback for the improvement of the initial
   simulations, and this by eliminating and/or improving unnecessary
   movements and collisions. The results of this study have a positive
   significance in the improvement of the system once these are
   implemented.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Internet technology, as a product of
   manufacturing technology and simulation technology, virtual assembly
   technology provides a good condition for the product assembly display.
   Although 3D printing has become more and more popular as a new printing
   technology, the assembly display of 3D printer is very scarce. In this
   study, the way to achieve the production of virtual assembly display
   platform for 3D printers is introduced to meet the needs of new product
   development, maintenance and operation training. Makerbot Replicator2 3D
   printer is used and the structure of 3D printer is modeled through the
   3D modeling software Solidworks. Afterward, the processes of mapping and
   animation are conducted in 3ds Max. Finally, the fabrication of the
   interactive display platform is completed in the import VRP. What is
   obtained is the virtual assembly platform which can realize the function
   of model display and assembly demonstration of 3D printer. The
   application of virtual reality technology to 3D printer can present the
   overall structure and function of 3D printer in a digital interactive
   mode so that it will no longer be restricted by environment and location
   conditions. Besides, it also provides a new way for the design,
   improvement, maintenance and management of industrial products, which is
   convenient to users to understand the internal and external structure
   and related functions of the 3D printer as quickly as possible.}},

   learning, the CNN generates a caustic image from a depth image within 55
   milliseconds. In addition, the similarity between the generated caustic
   images and the ground truth shows that our method is very promising for
   the generation of caustic images for a number of known objects, though
   the method does not handle objects in which ground truth is not already
   known. This method can play an important role in scenes used for stage

Abstract = {{As part of a global production strategy, many manufacturing companies
   locate their assembly plants in different countries around the world.
   While outsourcing final assembly closer to key markets has competitive
   benefits, these companies face new challenges with communication and
   dissemination of information. Concerning shop-floor operators
   specifically, these challenges affect the initial training and
   continuing improvement work instructions in particular. Emerging
   information and communication technology (ICT) have created new
   opportunities for supporting operators cognitively. In this paper, an
   immersive virtual reality (IVR) training environment for LEGO gearbox
   assembly was developed and tested. IVR technologies offer new
   opportunities where operators can access training and work instructions
   in an immersive environment, which could potentially improve and
   influence the operator performance and emotion. Both objective
   performance and subjective emotion were measured and the impacts were
   analyzed. The results were compared with four different operator support
   approaches and it was seen that IVR technology has the potential of
   improving operator and that further studies on integration, information,
   communication design and development of measurement methods are needed
   before the industry can benefit from the full potential of IVR
   technology. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{With the explosion of Virtual Reality technologies, the production and
   usage of omni directional images (a.k.a 360 images) is presenting new
   challenges in the domains of compression, transmission and rendering.
   The evaluation of the quality of images generated by these technologies
   is therefore paramount. As the exploration of 360 images within a
   Head-Mounted Display (HMD) is non-uniform, current state of the art
   proposes a saliency weighting of distortions (between a reference and an
   impaired version) thus allowing us to highlight impairments in
   frequently attended regions. So far, saliency maps have been generated
   by tracking head motion alone, and consider that the view-port
   orientation alone is sufficient to determine saliency. The added value
   of eye gaze tracking within the viewport has not been studied in this
   domain yet. In this work, an eye-tracking experiment is performed using
   a HMD and is followed by subsequent gaze analysis to appreciate the
   visual attention behavior within a view-port. Results suggest that most
   eye-gaze fixations are rather far away from the center of the viewport.
   Across contents and observers, gaze fixations are quasiisotropically
   distributed in orientation. The average location of gaze fixation
   (across contents and observers) from the center of the view-port varies
   between 14 and 20 visual degrees and these values correspond to a shift
   in retina beyond the para and peri fovea, into the extra-perifoveal
   region. A saliency weighting model based on foveation, centered at the
   middle of the view-port seems to be a correct assumption in only 2.5\%
   of the overall scenarios and is consequently questionable. Therefore
   there is a need to refine saliency modeling and weighting for quality
   assessment in case of panoramic viewing.}},

   connected with the introduction of Industry 4.0 concept into SMEs with
   the main focus on the construction sector. For this purpose, an analysis
   was made, based on the most recent literature, to point out actual needs
   in the SMEs sector in terms of its evolution into 4.0 level. What is
   more, the analysis was performed based on the most popular articles
   published in journals available in Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core
   Collection database regarding Industry 4.0 concept in the last decade
   showing the actual change of interest in this filed, taking into account
   possibility of usage of this concept in the construction and production
   sector. Authors tried to describe current knowledge regarding Industry
   4.0 introduction for SMEs. Performed analysis showed that there is a
   wide spectrum of disciplines that are affected by the Industry 4.0 that
   needs to be examined considering introduction into SMEs. Study also
   showed that multidiscipline approach was not investigated so far to
   create special rules, procedures and methods and know-how designed for
   introduction of main principles of Industry 4.0 in the SME sector.
   Authors came to the conclusions that there should be more stress put
   into research in this field especially taking into account the huge
   potential which lies in SME sector in terms of global economic strength.}},

Journal = {{FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{9-20}},
Abstract = {{The virtual has remained ``invisible{''} in Renaissance studies in
   spite, and probably because, of the developing virtual reality
   technologies and their most expedient potential in military training,
   games, and teledildonics. When it does attract scholarly attention, it
   is still in conjunction with negative connotations it has received in
   contemporary philosophy and culture, linking it to the unreal,
   simulacra, visual fake, copy or ``false approximation{''}. It is not
   surprising then that both in contemporary and Renaissance studies Satan
   appears to be the creator of the virtual. However, the virtual must not
   be confused with the visual or actualized forms that it effects. It is a
   powerful impulse that becomes perceptible in transductions of sensible
   things from one medium into another, like sound into architectural
   structures or visible forms. The Renaissance culture teems with such
   transduction. A very significant one occurs in the area of linguistics
   as language-already transduced from sound into writing-becomes
   virtualized for the second time by the printing press. What Bill Gates
   and others have done to virtualize the individual and community in our
   time, another Bill, William Caxton, did for England at the end of the
   fifteenth century. Mass production of books led to transductional
   activities of translation, reading, and interpretation, creating new
   virtual spaces and communities outside of the existing monopolies of
   knowledge. Within those virtual environments a new form of collective
   intelligence emerged which was not in the service of preserving
   knowledge as a fixed entity but subjected everything to an act of
   exploration. The prophet as initiator of virtual worlds was replaced by
   explorer. Accordingly, John Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost, as
   initiator and explorer of virtual worlds, ceases to be a fixed entity
   himself.}},

Abstract = {{This article addresses the field of headphone theatre, drawing on Lars
   Ellestrom's framework of the modalities of mediation to elucidate the
   audience experience of sonic virtual reality. Located within a wider

   headphone theatre stages the act of listening, drawing attention to the
   performance of the listener's perceptual apparatus as they realize and
   render the sonic environment. This article examines the audience
   experience of three headphone theatre productions that took place in
   London in 2014: David Rosenberg and Glen Neath's Ring (2014), Lundahl
   and Seitl's Symphony for a Missing Room (2009-), and David Rosenberg and
   Frauke Requardt's The Roof (2014). In these productions, the
   spatiotemporal, sensory, and material modalities (Ellestrom) combine to
   facilitate an immersive yet self-reflexive engagement that emphasizes
   the listener's visual imagination, auditory processing, and haptic
   engagement. As the use of binaural sound triggers the body to react to
   an imagined environment, headphone theatre accentuates the mediatized
   synergy of body and world, and reveals the performance of perception.}},

Abstract = {{Motion control system is an irreplaceable technology for bringing
   creative ideas into reality in visual effects production. It could
   implement complex camera movements as well as repeat the same movement
   several times, but there still exists limitations for its expensiveness
   and complexity to operate. In on-set shooting, it often takes times of
   motion planning and shooting test to get desired footage, which is time
   consuming, low efficiency and high costs. If the shot could be
   previsualized at virtual environment in advance, it would save shooting
   time, raise efficiency and reduce the costs. By using this approach, all
   kinds of design and test work is pre-finished during the Previz stage.
   The motion data of the camera is able to be converted into formats
   supported by motion control system thus could be used on-set directly.
   To meet this requirement, this paper designs a real-time interactive
   Previz simulation platform which could be applied on motion control
   system. This system previsualizes footages and perform device testing in
   virtual environment, and the Previz data could be used directly on real
   motion control system in on-set shooting.}},

Abstract = {{In order to solve the problem that the training equipment is few and the
   training items are single, the students can not connect the learned
   skills with the actual production of the enterprise, a new idea is put
   forward to control the virtual 3D-model with the electronic components
   such as PLC, relay, switch and so on in Irai software. Through
   establishing contact between PLC and the model of tool controller
   mechanism for machining center based on Irai software, a platform is
   built for the experiments and training of mechatronics such as machine
   control, PLC and CNC machine tools installation and maintenance. The
   mechanical structure with large space, high cost and complicated
   structure can be virtual, and the electrical control part is real, thus
   solving the problems in the actual teaching and promoting the
   development of mechatronics teaching.
   Nowadays, virtual reality technology (referred to as VR) is gradually
   integrated into all aspects of our lives. VR is a kind of technology
   which provide immersion feeling in interactive three-dimensional
   environment that generates on the computer by using computer graphics
   system, various realities and interface devices. In the school teaching
   level, VR technology can solve the lack of experimental equipment and
   security risks in physical experimental equipment in teaching of various
   schools. For example, in the current PLC simulation training courses,
   students can only program on the PLC to achieve controlling motor
   rotation and LED lights{[}1]. Large, and complex mechanical structure
   can not be truly controlled.
   Engineering Training Center of Tianjin University of Technology and
   Education introduced a number of vertical machining centers, which had a
   good effect in training teaching. In order to make students having a
   more in-depth understanding of the NC system automation and make the
   further development of the mechatronics teaching, a new idea of real -
   time PLC control training for 3D virtual mechanical mechanism by using
   VR technology is presented. By generating solid modeling in Catia and
   other 3D drawing software and communicating with the external real PLC
   through the virtual control platform building by Irai, the real control
   on the virtual three-dimensional model will be realized. With the
   simulation system combined with virtual reality applying in the
   mechatronics training, the problems of laboratory teaching will be
   solved.}},

Abstract = {{The insufficiency in the number of skilled technicians becomes the main
   problem of many (not only industrial) companies in the Czech Republic
   and other EU countries. The seriousness of the situation is proved by
   the tendency to invest funds in the material equipment of schools,
   technical education and solutions that link theory with practice. It is
   necessary to realize that the future professionals are being prepared
   for the positions in fast-changing area of industry. The change is
   enhanced by the rapid evolution of technologies, i.e. the so-called
   Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). This concept was officially
   introduced at the 2013 Hannover Fair. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
   is a term describing cyber - physical systems, which bring radical
   changes in the production process.
   The overall development in the EU countries in recent years has shown
   that the working competences in many professions vary in comparison with
   the past. Current trends in the development of technologies tend to
   downsize or revise certain working specializations. Certain new
   specializations have been created in some areas with growing demand for
   skilled professionals, mainly in connection with IT systems. An example
   might be the development in car-repairs, where the competencies in
   electronics are becoming essential, especially with respect to the
   electro-mobility.
   This development leads to the corresponding changes in the system of
   technical vocational education at the national and international level.
   This article describes the main areas of impact of the innovation
   process on technical vocational education. The main sub-themes addressed
   are the following:
   Analysis of the competencies and skills of workers and technicians in
   smart factories.
   Induced changes in curriculum, introducing of new courses in vocational
   training.
   Induced changes in training of teachers of vocational subjects.
   Impact of robotics, automation and 3D technologies on technical
   training.
   Internet, virtual and augmented reality.
   The paper brings some results of the research that was focused on the
   readiness of the Czech vocational subject teachers for the upcoming the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution.}},

Abstract = {{We explore how scaling a user's tracking data may impact performance in
   an immersive virtual reality game, which may have implications for
   fairness and accessibility of many applications. In our study, which
   used an HTC Vive room-scale VR system, users play the role of a factory
   worker who must remove deformed bread from a production line. Users were
   scaled to a reference height, such that taller than average users were
   rendered shorter and had shorter reach and shorter than average users
   were rendered taller and had longer reach than normal. Users also
   performed with unscaled tracking data. Our analysis indicates that there
   was no systematic advantage of being taller or shorter than normal, and
   scaling users may have had a detrimental effect. Moreover, scale changes
   were noticed by many users who had conflicting preferences for various
   application-specific reasons, indicating that application strategy can
   be affected by scale. Results suggest that while virtual reality
   tracking data may be scaled to compensate for user differences in
   physical height or reach, care must be taken to ensure that performance
   will benefit.}},

Title = {{Digital consumers as cultural curators: the irony of Vaporwave}},
Journal = {{ARTS AND THE MARKET}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{191-212}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the question of
   cultural production, consumption and intermediation in the context of
   digital music.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research adopts an interpretivist,
   ethnoconsumerist epistemology along with a netnographic research design
   combined with hermeneutic analysis. Interpreting both the text view and
   field view of an ethnoconsumerist approach, the netnographic research
   design includes participant observation across multiple social media
   platforms as well as virtual interviews and analysis of media material.
   The context of application is a digital music subculture known as
   Vaporwave. Vaporwave participants deliberately distort fundamental
   aspects of modern and postmodern culture in a digital, musical, artistic
   and storied manner.
   Findings - Hermeneutic analysis has identified a critical and nostalgic
   narrative of consumerism and hyper-reality, evident as symbolic
   parallels, intertextual relationships, existential themes and cultural
   codes. As a techno savvy community embracing lo-fi production,
   self-releasing promotion and anonymity from within a complexity of
   aliases and myriad collaborations, the vaporous existentialism of
   Vaporwave participants skirts copyright liability in the process.
   Accordingly, Vaporwave is documented as blurring reality and fantasy,
   material and symbolic, production and consumption. Essentially,
   Vaporwave participants are shown to be digital natives turned digital
   rebels and heretical consumers, better described as cultural curators.
   Research limitations/implications - This research demonstrates a more
   complex notion of cultural production, consumption and intermediation,
   argued to be more accurately described as cultural curation.
   Practical implications - As digital heretics, Vaporwave participants

   optical combiners for the use in augmented and virtual reality (AR and

   structures - being lightweight, thin and flat - make them perfectly
   suitable for use in integrated optical components like spectacle lenses
   and car windshields. While being transparent in Off-Bragg condition,
   they provide full color capability and adjustable diffraction

   Important for any commercialization are simple and robust mass

   step-and-repeat process. In this contact-copy scheme, Bayfol (R) HX film
   is laminated to a master stack before being exposed by a scanning laser
   line. Subsequently, the film is delaminated in a controlled fashion and
   bleached. We explain working principles of the one-beam copy concept and
   discuss the mechanical construction of the installed vHOE replication

Abstract = {{Over the years approach focusing in ergonomics has changed. We still
   talk about identification - analysis - elimination of the risks on the
   workplaces. But differences are at the possibilities of modem
   ergonomics, movement of science and technical possibilities. The options
   of using a mobile applications, Internet of Things, data gathering and
   their real time evaluation and their sharing. We present those solutions
   that combine traditional knowledge and modem technologies. The results
   are innovative and advanced ergonomic tools based on Industry 4.0
   concept. Electronic tools are a new direction in ergonomics. With the
   support of mobile applications we see a way to create healthy conditions
   at work for production and also non -production workers, assembly and
   logistics. At the beginning of 20-th century, majority of us had no idea
   what the ergonomics is, how many risks occur during our job that they
   are connected with the health of employees and have not known that
   special methods and tools for their identification, analysis, evaluation
   and identification are developed. With the growing development of
   society we got to stadium when, luckily, majority of companies -
   employers even know the meaning of ergonomics or work risks, about risks
   at their workplaces and establish their evaluation and try to eliminate
   them. We have many methods and tools of modern ergonomics which enable
   us to realize analysis and optimization of employee's work to their
   benefit. Considering experience we can surely claim that we know the
   main problem of these days. It is requisite to realize ergonomic
   evaluation perfectly, extensively and mainly quickly. Slowness of some
   solutions discourages managers and directors and makes effective
   improving of work conditions impossible. The idea of mobile application
   developing which works as a screening tool came with demands from big
   companies that have dozens of workplaces and cannot identify work risks
   by themselves. Ceit ERgonomics Analysis Application, which is described
   in article, is output of our own research and development. It is a
   mobile application developed in CEIT Company in collaboration with the
   University of Zilina and Slovak ergonomic association. It is a screening
   evaluation of space conditions and work positions of workers at
   potentially risky workplaces. It is developed at the base of legislation
   and technical nom's, at our own platform, with the support of virtual
   and augmented reality. The main goal of evaluation by the CERAA usage is
   to find out if the workplace is risky from the ergonomic view. It is an
   innovative way of applied augmented reality tools during the ergonomic
   evaluation of chosen workplaces. Nowadays, the new submodules are being
   developed. They will identify risks at administrative workplaces,
   submodule which will evaluate working with loads and other that will
   evaluate repetitive operations. CERAA is used in several industrial
   companies in Slovakia and Czech Republic from the second half of 2016.

Abstract = {{Through the use of recent technological advances, such as virtual- and
   augmented-reality validation techniques, many companies were able to
   reduce the number of physical prototypes used during their production
   planning process and thus improve their Time-To-Market. However,
   substituting physical prototypes in production planning comes at a cost,
   as validation results obtained from virtual-or augmented-reality
   techniques are not as reliable as those conventionally generated.
   Considering the fact that up to 85\% of a product's life cycle costs are
   determined during product- and production planning {[}1,2] raises the
   question, at which point accelerating the planning process compromises
   its effectiveness and thus has a negative impact on the Life Cycle
   Costs. To answer this question, this paper discusses a novel approach to
   measure the success rate of non-physical prototype validation techniques
   and, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation, calculate a product's
   production-readiness. This contemplation allows an algorithm-based
   identification of part-specific validation activities that need to be
   carried out in order to ensure a satisfying degree of
   production-readiness while minimizing the number of physical prototypes
   needed. Our time-saving and effective approach has been implemented as a
   software-tool (SIMBAPLAN (R)) and put to use at a German Commercial
   Vehicle Manufacturer. Based on this use case, potentials and limitations
   of the approach are discussed and areas for future research are derived.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years a lot of robot builder companies launched their
   collaborative robots, enabling the human-robot interaction in the same
   workspace. The main issue by the workspace sharing and/or co-working

   operators. For that reason the co-working speed is limited to 250mm/s,
   which is far less than a cage surrounded, robot cell production speed.
   Using the collaborative features of the mentioned robots, the robot

   The purpose of this study is to present the possibility of collaboration

   collision analysis in a virtual environment and control of the real
   robot so that the collision does not occur in reality. This will give
   the possibility to stop in time the robot, or even to generate collision

Abstract = {{We propose an acoustic-VR system that converts acoustic signals of human
   language (Chinese) to realistic 3D tongue animation sequences in real
   time. It is known that directly capturing the 3D geometry of the tongue
   at a frame rate that matches the tongue's swift movement during the
   language production is challenging. This difficulty is handled by
   utilizing the electromagnetic articulography (EMA) sensor as the
   intermediate medium linking the acoustic data to the simulated virtual
   reality. We leverage Deep Neural Networks to train a model that maps the
   input acoustic signals to the positional information of pre-defined EMA
   sensors based on 1,108 utterances. Afterwards, we develop a novel
   reduced physics-based dynamics model for simulating the tongue's motion.
   Unlike the existing methods, our deformable model is nonlinear,
   volume-preserving, and accommodates collision between the tongue and the
   oral cavity (mostly with the jaw). The tongue's deformation could be
   highly localized which imposes extra difficulties for existing spectral
   model reduction methods. Alternatively, we adopt a spatial reduction
   method that allows an expressive subspace representation of the tongue's
   deformation. We systematically evaluate the simulated tongue shapes with
   real-world shapes acquired by MRI/CT. Our experiment demonstrates that
   the proposed system is able to deliver a realistic visual tongue
   animation corresponding to a user's speech signal.}},

Abstract = {{For live television broadcast such as the educational program for
   children conducted through viewer participation, the smooth integration
   of virtual contents and the interaction between the casts and them are
   quite important issues. Recently there have been many attempts to make
   aggressive use of interactive virtual contents in live broadcast due to
   the advancement of AR/VR technology and virtual studio technology. These
   previous works have many limitations that do not support real-time 3D
   space recognition or immersive interaction. In this sense, we propose an
   augmented reality based real-time broadcasting system which perceives
   the indoor space using a broadcasting camera and a RGB-D camera. Also,
   the system can support the real-time interaction between the augmented
   virtual contents and the casts. The contribution of this work is the
   development of a new augmented reality based broadcasting system that
   not only enables filming using compatible interactive 3D contents in
   live broadcast but also drastically reduces the production costs. For
   the practical use, the proposed system was demonstrated in the actual
   broadcast program called ``Ding Dong Dang Kindergarten{''} which is a
   representative children educational program on the national broadcasting
   channel of Korea.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an experiment that evaluates the influence of
   audience noise on the feeling of presence and the perceived quality in a
   virtual reality concert experience delivered using Wave Field Synthesis.
   A 360 degree video of a live rock concert from a local band was
   recorded. Single sound sources from the stage and the PA system were
   recorded, as well as the audience noise, and impulse responses of the
   concert venue. The audience noise was implemented in the production
   phase. A comparative study compared an experience with and without
   audience noise. In a between subject experiment with 30 participants we
   found that audience noise does not have a significant impact on
   presence. However, qualitative evaluations show that the naturalness of
   the sonic experience delivered through wave field synthesis had a
   positive impact on the participants.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental teaching of surveying is an effective method for
   students to acquire basic surveying skills and solve practical problems.
   By contrast, the traditional experimental teaching mode of surveying
   presents students with insufficient experimental opportunities and
   difficulties to achieve independent learning and interactive operation
   due to limitations in the allotted time for experiments, sites,
   instruments, and external environmental conditions. This study developed
   a virtual experimental system by combining network virtual reality
   technology and surveying experiment. The proposed system intends to
   provide students with additional experimental opportunities to achieve
   computer desktop-like virtual experimental devices and engineering
   construction scenes, thereby accomplishing the indoor simulation of
   field surveying. This virtual surveying experimental system mainly
   comprised four modules, namely, classroom teaching, classroom practice,
   teaching practice, and production practice. This system realized
   equipment, operation, and data virtualizations, as well as various
   highly realistic measurement experiments, such as topographic surveying,
   engineering setting out, and road surveying. Application results
   demonstrated that the proposed system was convenient for the independent
   study of students, stimulates their enthusiasm for learning, strengthens
   their operational ability, and achieves good teaching effect.
   Furthermore, this system provides a novel experimental teaching mode for

   important task within the analysis of energy models. The representation
   of these models is especially important in urban areas, in which the

Abstract = {{The article considers the possibility of transdisciplinary research
   methodology of information-resonant processes in social structures. The
   author believes that existing general theories of modern society have
   exhausted themselves. New scientific revolution is brewing. The reason
   for this is the transformation of information resource of social life
   and characters in modern production. Recourse to the concept of
   information as the basis for the establishment of sociological theory of
   contemporary society involves the creation of a special methodology.
   This methodology is available as a transdisciplinary integrating
   sociology methods with methods of the natural sciences and general
   scientific methodology. The result of this integration is to create a
   new theoretical object. The author believes that the way the impact of
   information on social processes is a resonant wave motion in the flow of
   information. The author examines the relationship between social
   transformation and the growth of information flows. Sign-symbolic and
   semantic worlds consist in intensive interaction with the substantive
   peace society and evoke powerful headwind response-resonance. Under the
   influence of informational resonance are transformed all the elements of
   the social system. Opened and analyzed is the effect of informational
   resonance. Resonance is born within information flows and social
   structures. The basis for the elaboration of methodology for studying
   information and resonant processes may become the theory of vortex-wave
   and structural resonance. Information resonance are approach gives
   possibility to select from a wide variety of resonant social structures
   wave information flows and on this basis to interpret emerging
   structural abnormalities in contemporary society - anomie, deviation,
   crises and disasters. Transdisciplinary methodology allows to create a
   new theoretical object - information theory of resonance in social
   systems. This is model of informational-resonant mechanism reproduction
   of society. On its basis we can reveal hidden causal relationships in
   social processes. Opened and analyzed are the mechanism of mutation of
   social action. Social action breaks up the virtual and actual actions.
   The author substantiates the claim that information explosion puts
   social systematic destruction. Structures of everyday life immersed
   individuals in space constructed alternatives to social reality. The
   author argues that the individualized society became a reality and has
   acquired the look of ``quantified social reality{''}. Consideration is
   being given to use in social theory of quantum paradigm approach in
   version ``of relativity states{''} by H. Everett. ``Shadow{''} social
   actions are interpreted as hidden shadow connotations.}},

Journal = {{JMIR SERIOUS GAMES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background: Existing research suggests that digital games can be used
   effectively for educational purposes at any level of training.
   Perioperative nursing educators can use games to complement curricula,
   in guidance and staff development programs, to foster team
   collaboration, and to give support to critical thinking in nursing
   practice because it is a complex environment.
   Objective: To describe the process of developing an educational game to
   set up surgical instruments on the Mayo stand or back table as a
   resource to assist the instructor in surgical instrumentation training
   for students and nursing health professionals in continued education.
   Methods: The study was characterized by applied research in production
   technology. It included the phases of analysis and design, development,
   and evaluation. The objectives of the educational game were developed
   through Bloom's taxonomy. Parallel to the physical development of the
   educational game, a proposed model for the use of digital elements in
   educational game activities was applied to develop the game content.
   Results: The development of the game called ``Playing with Tweezers{''}
   was carried out in 3 phases and was evaluated by 15 participants,
   comprising students and professional experts in various areas of
   knowledge such as nursing, information technology, and education. An
   environment was created with an initial screen, menu buttons containing
   the rules of the game, and virtual tour modes for learning and
   assessment.
   Conclusions: The ``digital{''} nursing student needs engagement,
   stimulation, reality, and entertainment, not just readings. ``Playing
   with Tweezers{''} is an example of educational gaming as an innovative
   teaching strategy in nursing that encourages the strategy of involving
   the use of educational games to support theoretical or practical
   classroom teaching. Thus, the teacher does not work with only 1 type of
   teaching methodology, but with a combination of different methodologies.
   In addition, we cannot forget that skill training in an educational game
   does not replace curricular practice, but helps.}},

Abstract = {{The appearance of computers as super-brain inspires the hope that
   archaeology will solve the problem of the multidimensional data
   presentation. Since 1970s, the international conferences on the computer
   application in archaeology have discussed the advantages of new
   technologies. During one of them in 1990, the term virtual archaeology
   was introduced for the first time by Paul Reilly. He discussed both
   possibilities: visualizing in the computer screen the total amount of
   data obtained from the fieldwork and using the technologies applied in
   the computer games production for scientific aims. The word
   visualization also became the keyword of the definition given 20 years
   later in the International Charter on Virtual Drchaeology. However, in
   2007, this interpretation was exposed to critic. Virtual archaeology
   aims at the application of computer technologies for the creation of
   high-quality images of archaeological objects as well as in assistance
   to the archaeological studies. Time has gone; many applied sciences
   introduced computer technologies, and the possibility to unify and
   accumulate, to analyse and to demonstrate data appeared. Today, any big
   scientific research of the archaeological monument supposes the
   application of natural sciences and computer technologies. The
   archaeological excavations and virtual archaeology are parts of one
   infinite process, and the virtual archaeology means all the newest kinds
   of computer technologies used for archaeological investigations, data
   processing, modeling, archaeological and historical reconstruction and
   evident representation of their results. Since the time of Paul Reilly's
   definition, the meaning of the term virtual transformed from imaginary
   to existing in our understanding. It looks curious, but maybe very soon,
   instead of virtual archaeology, it will be possible to say up-today
   archaeology.}},

   between HRTFs, providing a qualitative understanding of the perceptual
   variance of non-individual binaural renderings. The list of attributes
   was designed using a Consensus Vocabulary Protocol elicitation method.
   Participants followed an Individual Vocabulary Protocol elicitation
   procedure, describing the perceived differences between binaural stimuli
   based on binauralized extracts of multichannel productions. This was
   followed by an automated lexical reduction and a series of consensus
   group meetings during which participants agreed on a list of relevant
   attributes. Finally, the proposed list of attributes was then evaluated
   through a listening test, leading to eight valid perceptual attributes
   for describing the perceptual dimensions affected by HRTF set
   variations. (C) 2016 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Foveated rendering synthesizes images with progressively less detail
   outside the eye fixation region, potentially unlocking significant
   speedups for wide field-of-view displays, such as head mounted displays,
   where target framerate and resolution is increasing faster than the
   performance of traditional real-time renderers.
   To study and improve potential gains, we designed a foveated rendering
   user study to evaluate the perceptual abilities of human peripheral
   vision when viewing today's displays. We determined that filtering
   peripheral regions reduces contrast, inducing a sense of tunnel vision.
   When applying a postprocess contrast enhancement, subjects tolerated up
   to 2x larger blur radius before detecting differences from a
   non-foveated ground truth. After verifying these insights on both
   desktop and head mounted displays augmented with high-speed
   gaze-tracking, we designed a perceptual target image to strive for when
   engineering a production foveated renderer.
   Given our perceptual target, we designed a practical foveated rendering
   system that reduces number of shades by up to 70\% and allows coarsened
   shading up to 30 degrees closer to the fovea than Guenter et al.
   {[}2012] without introducing perceivable aliasing or blur. We filter
   both pre-and post-shading to address aliasing from undersampling in the
   periphery, introduce a novel multiresolution-and saccade-aware temporal
   antialising algorithm, and use contrast enhancement to help recover
   peripheral details that are resolvable by our eye but degraded by
   filtering.
   We validate our system by performing another user study. Frequency
   analysis shows our system closely matches our perceptual target.
   Measurements of temporal stability show we obtain quality similar to
   temporally filtered non-foveated renderings.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a concept capability demonstration
   pilot study, the aim of which was to investigate how inexpensive gaming
   software and hardware technologies could be exploited in the development
   and evaluation of a simulator prototype for training Royal Navy mine
   clearance divers, specifically focusing on the detection and accurate
   reporting of the location and condition of underwater ordnance. The
   simulator was constructed using the Blender open source 3D modelling
   toolkit and game engine, and featured not only an interactive 3D editor
   for underwater scenario generation by instructors, but also a real-time,
   3D After Action Review (AAR) system for formative assessment and
   feedback. The simulated scenarios and AAR architecture were based on
   early human factors observations and briefings conducted at the UK's
   Defence Diving School (DDS), an organisation that provides basic
   military diving training for all Royal Navy and Army (Royal Engineers)
   divers. An experimental pilot study was undertaken to determine whether
   or not basic navigational and mine detection components of diver
   performance could be improved as a result of exposing participants to
   the AAR system, delivered between simulated diving scenarios. The
   results suggest that the provision of AAR was accompanied by significant
   performance improvements in the positive identification of simulated
   underwater ordnance (in contrast to non-ordnance objects) and on
   participants' description of their location, their immediate in-water or
   seabed context and their structural condition. Only marginal
   improvements were found with participants' navigational performance in
   terms of their deviation accuracies from a pre-programmed expert search
   path. Overall, this project contributes to the growing corpus of
   evidence supporting the development of simulators that demonstrate the
   value of exploiting open source gaming software and the significance of
   adopting established games design techniques in delivering highly

   This study evaluated an intervention for people with aphasia delivered
   in a novel virtual reality platform called EVA Park. EVA Park contains a
   number of functional and fantastic locations and allows for interactive
   communication between multiple users. Twenty people with aphasia had 5
   weeks' intervention, during which they received daily language
   stimulation sessions in EVA Park from a support worker. The study
   employed a quasi randomised design, which compared a group that received
   immediate intervention with a waitlist control group. Outcome measures
   explored the effects of intervention on communication and language
   skills, communicative confidence and feelings of social isolation.
   Compliance with the intervention was also explored through attrition and
   usage data.
   Results
   There was excellent compliance with the intervention, with no
   participants lost to follow up and most (18/20) receiving at least 88\%
   of the intended treatment dose. Intervention brought about significant
   gains on a measure of functional communication. Gains were achieved by
   both groups of participants, once intervention was received, and were
   well maintained. Changes on the measures of communicative confidence and
   feelings of social isolation were not achieved. Results are discussed

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The available clinical guidelines for super-super obese
   patients (i.e., with body mass index (BMI) 60 kg/m(2)) that are not
   suitable for bariatric surgery mandate a palliative multidisciplinary
   treatment (i.e., production and maintenance of weight loss) provided in
   a center of excellence. However, the modality and the impact of this
   approach are still controversial. Moreover, it is not able to address
   the high level of body dissatisfaction and body distortions that are
   common among these patients.
   Clinical Presentation: We report the case of a non-operable super-super
   obesity - a 37 year old woman with a BMI of 62 kg/m(2) - receiving a
   specialized treatment for her obstructive sleep apnea. She entered a
   multidisciplinary program that promoted healthy behaviors, including
   physical activities and psychological intervention. To improve body
   dissatisfaction, which was linked to a significant multisensory
   impairment of body perception, she also entered a virtual reality (VR)
   body-swapping illusion protocol. At the end of the current
   investigation, the patient continued her multidisciplinary program,
   reporting an increase in the motivation for undertaking healthy behavior
   and a decrease in the anxiety feelings associated with her clinical
   condition.
   Conclusion: This case provides preliminary evidence that both body
   dissatisfaction and body-size distortions of non-operable super-super
   obesity patients could be addressed by a VR body-swapping protocol,
   which is important because the palliative multidisciplinary treatment
   recommended for these patients is not able to address them.
   Interestingly, the use of a VR body-swapping illusion protocol seems to
   be able to improve not only the experience of the body in these patients
   but their motivation for change, too.}},

Abstract = {{Bukit Merah karst has been deteriorating dramatically over 40 years due
   to intensification of human activities as a result of fast rate of
   lateral urbanization and extensive dimensional expansion of surface
   mining activities for instance, quarrying. Application of morphometric
   techniques to karst landforms provides a quantitative measurement and
   analysis of the configuration of karst landform variations. The
   objective of this study is to demonstrate the viability of using an
   integrated approach based on digital terrain model (DTM) derived
   time-series of steriopair aerial photography for monitoring the
   long-term geological karst response to environmental changes. The aerial
   photo stereo pairs were used to extract digital terrain model of the
   years 1981 and 2004, which in turn produced the TIN profiles of selected
   karst sites in the study area to define the karst morphology changes and
   to develop 3D representation and visualization. A detailed visualization
   of the karst terrain and its surface changes were represented using 3D
   virtual reality tool to substantiate the impact of surface mining in the
   Bukit Merah. Topographical characteristics of limestone hills,
   mountainous areas and flat areas were presented in 3D prospective. The
   results show the simulation topographical analysis results have
   confirmed that there were changes in elevation over the period from 1981
   to 2004 especially in the limestone hill area as detected by the digital
   elevation model. It showed a dramatic variation in elevation has
   increased over a time interval. This means there has occurred an
   interference with the terrain attributed to human intervention or
   natural causes during the time interval. The result shows that the
   digital terrain model (DTM) derived time-series of steriopair aerial
   photography is able to delineate the changes in karst topography. (C)

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) generally refers to an artificial environment,
   constructed using a computer and presented to the user in such a way
   that they feel they are inside an alternate world.
   In 2016, VR - the experience of exploring 360 degree photos and videos
   and to interact with computer generated characters and objects inside
   virtual worlds - has finally (after years of development) shown mass
   market commercial promise.
   While much of the VR revenue is currently being captured by hardware and
   software makers, it is not difficult to imagine value being captured by
   licensing access to user generated content (UGC) in VR. For example, as
   with videogames and professional sports, it might be possible to
   monetize the experience of watching players of exceptional ability as
   they play a VR game (e.g., gameplay by someone engaged in a VR eSport).
   Alternately, offering a global audience the opportunity to explore a
   work of art created by a master in VR (perhaps as the master is creating
   the work) could also present a source of revenue. Stakeholders,
   including VR app developers, gaming platforms and game production
   companies, will likely want to control revenue from UGC as it is in
   their commercial interest.
   In this article, we explore the potential for right of publicity,
   performance rights, and copyright protection for UGC in VR. VR has only
   been commercialized very recently and there have not been court
   decisions concerning the ownership of user generated content in a VR
   world. Therefore, to consider some of the legal questions that we
   anticipate will arise around VR, this paper examines court cases
   regarding the next closest forms of entertainment - video gameplay and
   sporting events.
   Having examined the court decisions and considering the room for
   creativity and performance given to VR users (in our view, significantly
   more authorship and protectable performance than that of video game
   players at the time of the court decisions), we conclude that in many
   circumstances UGC in VR could give rise to content that is protectable.
   In other words, at what appears to be the dawn of commercial VR, the
   question(s) at issue may not be whether UGC is protectable, but instead
   what rights exist and who has ownership of VR UGC.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The cue-reactivity procedure has demonstrated that smokers
   respond with increases in subjective craving in the presence of
   smoking-related cues. Virtual reality is an emerging mode of cue
   presentation for cue-reactivity research. Despite the successful
   implementation of virtual reality during the last decade, no systematic
   review has investigated the magnitude of effects across studies.
   Methods: This research systematically reviewed findings from studies
   using virtual reality in cigarette craving assessment. Eligible studies
   assessed subjective craving for cigarettes in smokers exposed to
   smoking-related and neutral environments. Cohen's d was used to assess
   differences in craving between smoking-related and nonsmoking-related
   virtual environments. A random effects approach was used to combine
   effect sizes.
   Results: A total of 18 studies involving 541 smokers was included in the
   final analyses. Environments with smoking-related cues produced
   significant increases in craving relative to environments without
   smoking-related cues. The mean overall effect size (Cohen's d) was 1.041
   (SE = 0.12, 95\% CI = 0.81 to 1.28, Z = 8.68, P <.001).
   Conclusions: The meta-analysis suggested that presentations of smoking
   cues through virtual reality can produce strong increases in craving
   among cigarette smokers. This strong cue-reactivity effect, which was
   comparable in magnitude to the craving effect sizes found with more
   conventional modes of cue presentation, supports the use of virtual
   reality for the generation of robust cue-specific craving in
   cue-reactivity research.}},

Abstract = {{Education about green energy, such as understanding of principles and
   applications of solar energy or wind power, is a crucial topic in
   general science courses. The course unit for the process development of
   energy-related materials includes topics that are complex and abstract,
   such as the principle of the n-type, and p-type semiconductors, or
   photoconductive effects in solar cells, thus hindering the learning
   process of learners who do not specialize in this field, when they read
   related books and attempt to understand physical and chemical phenomena.
   To assist such learners in enhancing their learning effectiveness, this
   study used an augmented reality-based learning (ARBL) method and virtual
   reality technology to help learners comprehend green energy. Through
   ARBL integrated with virtual reality technology, learners were presented
   with various types of visual media (including web pages, text and
   pictures, animations, videos, and interactive games) while they learn
   about the related green energy knowledge. Such visual presentations were
   used to illustrate the operating principles for the process development
   of solar energy production, reduce the number of abstract words, and
   enhance learner comprehension. In addition, a global positioning system
   (GPS) was integrated into ARBL to guide learners in visiting locations
   where green energy equipment (e.g., solar street lights) is used.
   Through observations, reflections, and cloud recording, learners
   documented the strengths and limitations of green energy use and
   proposed related application methods and innovative ideas. In cloud
   recording, text mining technology (Pang and Lee) and a word cloud (Cui
   et al.) were adopted to summarize crucial points and assist learners in
   understanding critical problems. Group discussion was conducted for
   learners to share their learning approaches, observations, and findings,
   thereby enhancing their learning effectiveness. The results of this
   study demonstrated that learners strongly accepted ARBL and were highly
   satisfied with this learning approach. Conclusions drawn in this study
   can serve as a reference for educators and educational institutions in
   designing courses.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropsychological and functional MRI data suggest that two functionally
   and anatomically dissociable streams of visual processing exist: a
   ventral perception-related stream and a dorsal action-related stream.
   However, relatively little is known about how the two streams interact
   in the intact brain during the production of adaptive behavior. Using
   functional MRI and a virtual three-dimensional paradigm, we aimed at
   examining whether the parieto-occipital junction (POJ) acts as an
   interface for the integration and processing of information between the
   dorsal and ventral streams in the near and far space processing. Virtual
   reality three-dimensional near and far space was defined by manipulating
   binocular disparity, with -68.76 arcmin crossed disparity for near space
   and +68.76 arcmin uncrossed disparity for near space. Our results showed
   that the POJ and bilateral superior occipital gyrus (SOG) showed
   relative increased activity when responded to targets presented in the
   near space than in the far space, which was independent of the
   retinotopic and perceived sizes of target. Furthermore, the POJ showed
   the enhanced functional connectivity with both the dorsal and ventral
   streams during the far space processing irrespective of target sizes,
   supporting that the POJ acts as an interface between the dorsal and
   ventral streams in disparity-defined near and far space processing. In
   contrast, the bilateral SOG showed the enhanced functional connectivity
   only with the ventral stream if retinotopic sizes of targets in the near
   and far spaces were matched, which suggested there was a functional
   dissociation between the POJ and bilateral SOG.}},

Abstract = {{Food waste is one of the main problems in our society. This is mainly
   caused by people's behaviors and attitudes, which influence the whole
   food chain, from production to final consumption. In fact, food is
   generally perceived as a commodity by adults, who transmit this behavior
   to children, who in turn do not develop any consciousness about food's
   source. One way to reduce the problem seems to be by changing consumers'
   attitudes, which develop during the early years of childhood. Research
   has shown that after attending school garden classes, children's
   food-related behavior changes. Growing crops is not always easy-it can't
   be done in the domestic space, and this lead to a loss of the long term
   positive effects. This paper presents a project that tries to teach
   children how to grow their own food indoors and outdoors, mixing real
   and virtual reality, connecting something natural like a plant to the
   Internet of Things (or IOT, a network of physical objects virtually
   connected to each other and to the web). The use of sensors related to
   an app makes this process more fun and useful for educational purposes.
   The aim of the project is to change children's attitude towards food,
   increasing their knowledge about production and consumption, in order to
   reduce waste on a long term basis. The research has been developed in
   collaboration with Cisco NL and MediaLAB Amsterdam. The user testing has
   been executed with Dutch children in Amsterdam.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual laboratories (VL) and interactive simulations are excellent
   approaches for training students to understand technical principles.
   This can be useful in many fields of science and engineering teaching.
   For this purpose, we have developed a virtual environment that can
   simulate real-laboratory operations, effectively enhancing the teaching

   learn and investigate on their own. The virtual lab is made of a
   web-based application to complement experimental laboratory training,
   allowing students to prepare their experimental practices before going
   to the lab, and to review them at any time afterwards. The computer
   application exhibits key virtual-lab educational features, like an
   integrative layout and self-evaluating tests. It allows a personalized

   students to evaluate the usefulness of the VL Such a tool was positively
   evaluated, achieving a mean score of 6 out of 7 points. Additionally,
   the VL efficiency in the learning process showed a final examination

Abstract = {{As a key technology, interactive animation has been widely used in
   Virtual Reality nowadays which is important for the success of various
   VR applications. However, despite many years history and the ability to
   produce stunning illusory and immersive effects for many VR
   applications, interactive animation generation remains one of the most
   labour-intensive ones. As a tedious task, its generation requires a
   complicated systematic procedure. Its inherent functional features
   involve a lot of complex technical problems: various aspects of
   requirements have to be handled, from the HCI technologies to the
   efficient management of animation data assets. With the continual
   evolvement of the complexity of current interactive VR technologies and
   animation practices, systematic and standardised description is
   imperative to provide a clear understanding of this production process.
   In this paper, a semantic framework is constructed at an abstract and
   semantic level using ontological methods for modelling the construction
   of interactive animation generation. To facilitate the process of
   interactive animation generation and improve its reusability and
   modularity, domain-specific ontologies based on the semantic framework
   are defined by formalising the multimodal interaction method and the
   construction of the animation data assets repository at the ontological
   implementation level. Finally, hand-gesture-based interactive animation
   is generated in the context of traditional Chinese shadow play, which
   involves novel functional features like hand-gesture-based interactive
   control and ontology-based intelligent animation assets management.}},

   training system was built and tested by 10 students who tried both the
   HMD-based system and a normal screen-based system to experience the
   difference between the two systems. The results showed that the
   HMD-based system can give a better user experience, and is easier to
   use. In the future, with the employment of more intuitive input devices
   and improved system software, the VR training system for mines could
   play a much more important role in mine training.}},

Abstract = {{This paper aims to present the results of an experimental activity of
   Media Education and Educational Robotics, based on the integration of
   the audiovisual language and coding. This case of study is part of a
   wide research about the role of the multimedia language and the
   innovation in Education, Pedagogy and in Anthropology of Media.
   Nowadays, we live in a hyper-connected and media-world: all our actions
   are, at the same time, in the virtual space and in the physical
   environment; we can do an act on the Web and give it a corresponding
   meaning and a true realization in reality. Thus, for example, when we
   organize a flash mob (or a social movement) with social networking
   sites, we would like to realize it for real, in the physical world: in
   this case, our virtual intentionality and speech acts become real
   actions (with real effects). Every day, we do many things with media and
   technologies; we not only use them to communicate but also to build
   concrete actions and media-products. Many of these productions could be
   part of a new collective knowledge and provide to increase a new media
   semiosphere (that is, also, a cognitive surplus). In this context, it is
   important that users (and, obviously, students) learn how to create and
   co-create new meanings with media language and technology.
   Our research group works on two experimental directions: first, we
   consider Media Education as a method to teach the grammar and syntax of
   multimedia language, to help students not only to read with media but
   also to write (that is they can participate in the collective creation
   of materials for the cognitive surplus increasing). Obviously, we want
   to educate them to communicate and produce meanings. They should acquire
   technological skills and digital competences and, above all, the
   awareness of the power of media language. Besides, media languages are
   used to exceed some learning difficulties and to support the dynamic
   inclusion. In the second way, we use educational robotics to increase
   some basic notions about the visual and spatial skills (above all, in
   primary schools) and to help students to acquire some processes of
   reasoning, such as the logic of the problem solving and the creative
   problem solving. Moreover, we use educational robotics to teach math and
   geometry procedures.
   Starting from by these aspects and from by previous technological and
   media laboratories (with school and academic students), we experiment an
   innovative methodological approach to realize videos video of
   storytelling with robots. In this activity, students create some short
   films, starting by their fantasy and working on the storytelling
   process; robots (Bee-bot and Pro-bot) are the protagonists of these
   videos. Students must ideate the tale, build the scene, programme robots
   and realize the video, thinking about robots can move and interact with
   others and with space, according to the script. In this way, students
   must consider what are the skills to realize a communicative video and,
   at the same time, what are the coding needs to move a robot and how it
   is possible to create a meaningful product with these technologies. In
   this paper, we describe this action, its educative aims and its results
   (obtained during the II edition of the Summer Junior University, 2015,
   Turin, Italy). Denicolai wrote 1, 2, 2.1 and 4 paragraphs, Grimaldi and

   trends in collaborative production and to understand how to improve the
   efficiency of a distributed virtual team. In order to achieve these
   goals, a cloud-based collaborative manufacturing platform was developed,
   for educational purposes. This platform, intends to simulate the entire
   product life cycle, in a virtual environment, combining the latest
   software tools available on the market. The collaborative product
   development platform is divided in 12 stages based on the product life
   cycle management (PLM) steps. It starts from a market study that leads
   to the concept creation, reverse engineering and product design. The
   next phase involves virtual testing and virtual manufacturing for the
   previously designed product. After these simulations the platform leads
   to rapid prototyping (3D printing) and a physical inspection of the 3D
   printed product. The final stages of the platform are marketing, client
   feedback, recycle and improvement. In order to improve the collaborative
   working environment, augmented reality is applied for almost all the
   stages of the platform, starting from the ``concept creation{''} to the
   ``marketing{''} stage. The augmented reality used consists in 3D CAD
   models or other digital information superimposed over environment. This
   collaborative platform is used by groups of students (which simulate a
   geographically dispersed virtual team) to develop new products using the
   PLM steps.}},

Abstract = {{Dangerous driving situations can arise from poor visibility due to
   weather conditions or sharp turns. These situations could be prevented,
   if the driver knew about the future road course, while still being on
   the lookout for obstacles. The Head-Up-Display (HUD) helps to keep the
   driver's gaze on the road by projecting virtual information onto the
   windshield. The electronic horizon provides information about the future
   road course. The Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Interface
   Specifications (ADASIS) aims to standardise the way the electronic
   horizon is distributed amongst the different ADAS applications. Within
   this work, we combined the HUD with the electronic horizon to create a
   visualisation of the future road course in the HUD. We implemented this
   visualisation in a car prototype. The application was developed by using
   automotive standards, to show feasibility of integrating such a
   visualisation into a series-production vehicle. In future work we intend
   to investigate the change of drivers' behaviour while using this
   application with a user study.}},

Abstract = {{The information society and knowledge economy represent specific
   environment for entrepreneurship. In traditional and modern societies
   the business is considered as particular societal function to satisfy
   human needs with raising efficiency. The mass industrial production
   assures the saturation of the existing needs and accelerates the
   constant shifts of innovative technologies in the form of the cyclic
   recurring economic seeking for the more efficient ways to satisfy the
   needs, and the appearance of the new preferences, evolved by marketing
   tools. Accelerated change as a fundamental feature of the post-modern
   universe concerns the basic elements of the human psychology (basic
   trust-mistrust crisis) and the essential phenomena of building economic
   networks. This evolution of the world volatile requires new effort of
   governance entailing more confidence. These concerns are on both macro
   and micro levels of activity. The institutional background for any
   economic activity includes the basic rules (such as property, money,
   contracts) and externalities (i.e., education, defense, justice). The
   last 5 years gave many examples of the search for new economic
   solutions, among them the ``de-offshoring{''} money flows from Cyprus to
   other European countries (due to debt crisis) and mistrust to the
   changing legislation that provokes the capital flight from a country
   (financial consequences of the decrees to raise social spending in
   Russian budget and followed reforms in Russian taxation). The
   micro-level social capital of any individual previously was based on the
   physical personal experience in small groups (family, closest friends)
   or middle communities (such as class-mates at school, colleagues from
   the first jobs). The shared past of physic reality is now substituted
   with the instantaneous acquaintances and short moments of comments and
   pictures in the virtual social places (Facebook, etc.). The traditional
   process of building trust and beliefs as result of shared experience is
   illustrated with quantitative analysis of the inter-personal situational
   relationship in the activity of trade-unions. This survey is based on
   the questionnaire in a ship-building corporation, where the extreme
   conditions of hand physical toil of high-skilled workers produce a
   strong intra-group and intra-organizational confidence and produces
   specific communications with the organizational environment. The new
   volatile social universe of corporate units was examined with the
   qualitative research based on interviews concerned the internal models
   of socio-cultural system of myths and legends inside organization. The
   company searches new combination of informal procedures with legal
   framework, compounding special organizational culture, behavioral
   stereotypes and posture. The special case of use of the trust-intensive
   activity is analyzed in a real-estate agency, where the trust is the
   essential asset in the situation of asymmetry of information: any deal
   is made only on the basis of the strong confidence towards the
   competences of an agent. The trust-building process is assessed with a
   quantitative survey and correlation and regression analysis, carried out
   after the qualitative focus-groups for evaluations the mechanisms of
   creating the special trustful organizational climate inside the agency.
   The results led to conclude on the further perspective of analyzing the
   trust in virtual universe within the myths as an essential confidence
   building mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Though it is hard to define `presence', it is often said to be a feeling
   of being in the place when watching artworks. Visual imagery is the
   visual perception registered from the eyes. The authors define
   ``presence{''} as a physiological and emotional feeling which feels that
   he or she is immerged in a specific virtual environment (VE) when he/she
   is very interested in the images of virtual reality (VR). The presence
   of image varies according to the production conditions and genre. While
   presence is a subjective experience, it is based on a perceptive
   reaction to the stimulation from the image. Accordingly, this study
   attempts to take measurement on how image affects presence. The authors
   measure the presence use a combined approach of subjective survey
   (questionnaire survey) and brain signals (EEG). Subjective survey
   includes PQS (presence questionnaire survey) and IDQS (individual
   differences questionnaire survey). For this paper, the authors
   experimented with 30 random populations, performed Cronbach's a test to
   verify the validity of the survey results, and cross-checked the survey
   with EEG test for the populations. From our experimentation, we conclude
   that opponent color (e.g. yellow and blue of the R. Plutchik's
   three-dimensional circumflex model of emotions) makes strong excitation
   on presence. In this paper, the authors believe that there are strong
   presence even in the nonfigurative images, and it can be stronger than
   photo-realistic images if we well-design color, forms, and interactivity
   on the VR.}},

Abstract = {{Manual operations in mass production are. important cost drivers. Thus,
   tools like the MTM (Methods-time Measurement) a time and motion study
   method were introduced, which are nowadays established in industry for
   evaluation and improvement of production facilities. In this method,
   cardboard engineering is used to build simplified physical mock-ups of
   machines or production lines, in which the manual working process can be
   simulated. However, new strategies like e.g. decentralized production
   require the worker to walk, which is not well incorporated in the MTM
   and times are only estimated from the walking distance.
   Since many workplaces, machines or production lines already exist as
   digital models, it is obvious to perform the MTM completely virtually.
   However, this comes at the cost of a complex handling and strongly
   reduced realism because a desktop-based MTM application does not allow
   natural navigation like walking within the full-sized models like the
   cardboard setups do.
   This paper introduces a virtual reality-based MTM that also allows for
   real walking in virtual factories without using a treadmill or other
   walking devices. With a subtle redirection of the user during walking,
   these virtual factories can even be larger than the available physical
   space. Hence, a realistic measuring of walking times and distances can
   be done instead of an estimation. Since the MTM can be completely
   performed within a virtual environment, it gives a new realism to the
   method compared to the cardboard procedure. The paper closes with an
   outlook on future work and extensions of this novel virtual MTM. (C)

Abstract = {{The advances in the digital technology of the entertainment industry
   have ushered a viewer into the dawn of virtual surround cinema. With the
   presence of technological pioneers such as NextVR Digital, Nokia OZO,
   Google Jump, Lytro Immerge, PanoCam3D, to name a few, the capture and
   display of 360 degrees ultra-high definition video that aims to offer an
   immersive physical and visual experience, both on big screens and on
   portable devices, is gradually becoming accessible to an average
   consumer. The current 360 degrees filmmaking (often referred to as
   spherical cinema), however, parrots the narrative and aesthetic schemata
   of the flat 2D films, and, in doing so, it binds the medium into an
   inelegant representation, unfit for the new digital setting. Because 360
   degrees film production is fundamentally an offshoot of the post-digital
   era, it inevitably gravitates towards the breakdown of the authoritarian
   structures producing a novel narrative and visual regime that departs
   from the classic spectatorships towards a deeply immersive psychosomatic
   experientiality. Warranted by VR technologies, such an experientiality
   is best served when rhizomatic narrative structure is deployed.
   Based on the concept of rhizome, which was fleshed out in Gilles
   Deleuze's and Felix Guattari's A thousand plateaus: Capitalism and
   Schizophrenia to advocate rhizome as the fundamental nucleus unto which
   social, aesthetic, political, and human interactive models could be
   built, as well as via simulation of video prototypes done in 360
   degrees, the author contends that rhizomatic thinking, is already locked
   within the essence of 360 degrees video. The question is not whether
   rhizomatic narrative should be espoused, but whether rhizomatic
   narrative can be advanced to the level where it superseded linear,
   non-linear, and interactive (albeit still linear) story structure, seen
   in video games and hypertext works, in addition of being set apart from
   the design of micro-narratives, so that the rhizome moved from being a
   mere Deleuzoguattarian metaphor to a practical utility used 360 degrees
   film production.}},

Abstract = {{The recent years of eventful industry development, brought many
   competing products, addressed to the same market segment. The shortening
   of a development cycle became a necessity if the company would like to
   be competitive. Because of switching to the Intelligent Manufacturing
   model the industry search for new scheduling algorithms, while the
   traditional ones do not meet the current requirements. The agent-based
   approach has been considered by many researchers as an important way of
   evolution of modern manufacturing systems. Due to the properties of the
   multi-agent systems, this methodology is very helpful during creation of
   the model of production system, allowing depicting both processing and
   informational part. The complexity of such approach makes the analysis
   impossible without the computer assistance. Computer simulation still
   uses a mathematical model to recreate a real situation, but nowadays the
   2D or 3D virtual environments or even virtual reality have been used for
   realistic illustration of the considered systems. This paper will focus
   on robotized manufacturing system and will present the one of possible
   approaches to the simulation of such systems. The selection of
   multi-agent approach is motivated by the flexibility of this solution
   that offers the modularity, robustness and autonomy.}},

Abstract = {{Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a unique form of online education
   enabled by web-based learning technologies, allow learners from anywhere
   in the world with any level of educational background to enjoy online
   education experience provided by many top universities all around the
   world. However, the forms of learning activities in MOOC settings are
   usually limited to watching lecture or tutorial videos, joining
   formative or summative assessments, discussing with peer students, etc.
   These modes of learning could greatly limit the learning experience of
   the learners particularly in appreciating and acquiring certain tacit
   knowledge that the course content aim to deliver, for example in courses
   that deal with the vast expanse of the environment or the spiritual
   aspect of a culture, etc. In this paper, we present the design,
   production and delivery techniques for smart phone enabled Virtual
   Reality (VR) educational content that can provide impactful immersive
   learning experience to MOOC learners. Specifically, we have applied the
   techniques in the production of a MOOC entitled ``Virtual Hong Kong: New
   World, Old Traditions{''}, led by AIMtech Centre, which, to our
   knowledge, is the first MOOC that delivers immersive learning content
   for distant learners to appreciate and experience how the traditional

Abstract = {{Real-time facial performance capture has recently been gaining
   popularity in virtual film production, driven by advances in machine
   learning, which allows for fast inference of facial geometry from video
   streams. These learning-based approaches are significantly influenced by
   the quality and amount of labelled training data. Tedious construction
   of training sets from real imagery can be replaced by rendering a facial
   animation rig under on-set conditions expected at runtime. We learn a
   synthetic actor-specific prior by adapting a state-of-the-art facial
   tracking method. Synthetic training significantly reduces the capture
   and annotation burden and in theory allows generation of an arbitrary
   amount of data. But practical realities such as training time and
   compute resources still limit the size of any training set. We construct
   better and smaller training sets by investigating which facial image
   appearances are crucial for tracking accuracy, covering the dimensions
   of expression, viewpoint and illumination. A reduction of training data
   in 1-2 orders of magnitude is demonstrated whilst tracking accuracy is
   retained for challenging on-set footage.}},

   connected to a social network (www.synopcity.com) where network's
   members are acting as a citizens developing new urban developments in a
   virtual world under specific rules and regulations. It will allow
   authors of paper to study complex social behavior of all parties
   responsible for city development and decision making processes based on
   available historical data collected during this experiment of dynamic
   social evolution model development. Citizens are actively participating
   on this process along with model authorities and community
   representatives following statutes, rules and law. Authors of paper are
   also proposing an implementation of Industry 4.0 principles. The city is
   acting as an Industry 4.0 factory where all processes and relation
   between product and production are mirrored between physical factory
   networked systems and factory's virtual model.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional way of visualizing the material flow in a production
   system is to use simulation tools and their integrated symbols and
   pictograms. By going this way, a good relation to reality does not
   really exist and thus it is nearly impossible to provide for all
   contingencies. This paper introduces a procedure which enables a virtual
   design review of the planned process layout in the HD visualization
   center at the Heinz Nixdorf Institute. This means that production
   planners have the opportunity to do a virtual inspection of the
   production including the visualized material flow. As a result, the
   planning certainty and the system comprehension of all parties involved
   significantly increase, so that the presented procedure serves as a
   valuable decision support. This paper describes the steps to be taken
   from production-data to an optimized material flow verified in a virtual
   inspection. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Existing localization solutions cannot be directly integrated into
   production systems. This article describes a nearfield localization
   system which can be installed on tools due to its small dimensions. Live
   data controlled manual assembly processes are enabled. In combination
   with worker information systems, the manual assembly process can be
   supported more precisely compared to common systems. The benefits are
   shown within product-specific assembly scenarios. One benefit is
   enabling work out of sight (non-visible range) guided through a virtual
   model on a screen. Error prevention (zero-defect assembly) can be
   realized by monitoring and matching the actual position to the assembly
   location. Even without augmented reality devices, comparative 3-D
   representations of real and virtual world are feasible, supporting
   employees in mobile workshop with complex repairs. In particular,
   difficult accessibility can be easily determined when carrying out

Abstract = {{In India, mining industry lacks technological innovation and the mining
   companies constantly striving to implement latest, reliable and cost
   effective automation technologies for their mines, to ensure high
   productivity and safety. Productivity of mines sometimes can be
   increased just by incorporating simple modifications in variables of the
   mine activities and operations which also boost up the safety
   conditions. Recent advancement in the technology especially with the
   application of Information Technology, it is now possible to identify
   the variables for improving existing production of mine with reduced
   operational cost, ensuring higher level of safety to the miners as well.
   Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is an effective tool to
   ensure safety in mining operations as it offers a real time tracking
   system during blasting and has the potential to revolutionise the mining
   operations. Radar technology has been widely popular for several decades
   globally, and can be a best tool to avert the hazards due to ground
   movement in surface mining. Field oriented training is of great
   importance in mining and realising that there is no substitute to the
   real life training, the mining sectors now-days tends to use different
   software to shorten the training time with ensuring the high quality of
   training. Virtual reality has the potential to cater the need of quality
   training with real time simulations of field conditions to the miners.
   This paper presents the application and need of RFID, radar based
   systems and virtual reality system in mining industry and presents a
   framework for future research areas.}},

Abstract = {{One goal of the Industry 4.0 initiative is to improve knowledge sharing
   among and within production sites. A fast and easy knowledge exchange
   can help to reduce costly down-times in factory environments. In the
   domain of automotive manufacturing, production line down-times cost in
   average about \$1.3 million per hour. Saving seconds or minutes have a
   real business impact and the reduction of such downtime costs is of
   major interest.
   In this paper we describe MARBAS, a Mobile Augmented Reality based
   Annotation System, which supports production line experts during their
   maintenance tasks. We developed MARBAS as Cyber-Physical Human System
   that enables experts to annotate a virtual representation of a real
   world scene. MARBAS uses a mobile depth sensor that can be attached to
   smart phones or tablets in combination with Instant Tracking. Experts
   can share information using our proposed system. We believe that such an
   annotation system can excel current maintenance processes by
   accelerating them.
   To identify applicable mesh registration algorithms we conducted a
   practical simulation. We used a 6 axis joint-arm robot to evaluate 7
   different ICP algorithms concerning time and accuracy. Our results show
   that PCL non-linear ICP offers best performance for our scenario.
   Additionally, we developed a vertical prototype using a mobile depth
   sensor in combination with a tablet. We could show the feasibility of
   our approach augmenting real world scenes with virtual information.}},

Abstract = {{In order to keep up with changing market demands like highly
   individualized products, automotive OEMs are facing these new
   requirements with mass-customization and more efficient digital methods.
   With the ongoing virtualization of production planning and verification,
   new technologies are necessary to facilitate interaction with virtual
   environments for planning experts.
   While marker-based motion capture systems have been used for tracking of
   worker movements and interaction with those digital models until now,
   with the advent of markerless tracking technologies like the Kinect
   depth cameras, those solutions attract more interest because of their
   reduced cost, ease of use and the absence of cumbersome suits and
   markers.
   However, when using depth cameras, which have been primarily designed as
   short-range gaming devices, different issues arise when dealing with
   large-scale setups common in shop floor and production planning
   environments. Similar to traditional motion capture systems, it is
   necessary to deal with occlusions, camera registration and calibration
   and fusion of multi-depth-camera data to obtain a sufficiently large and
   robust tracking space.
   For this purpose, we propose such a novel multi-depth-camera approach,
   which is able to register itself only by observing the worker's
   trajectory. It is then able to reliably track the worker movements
   across a large space and also optimize the skeletal tracking. Through
   its distributed and scalable approach, the multi-depth camera system can
   be set up flexible for versatile tracking scenarios in practical
   production planning use. Based on sensor hardware specific quality
   criteria, it is able to fuse incoming tracking data and to provide a
   coherent view of the tracking space even in difficult tracking
   situations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an

   technology (creation of an environment and avatars in different
   scenarios) designed for educational purposes (training and assessment)
   to simulate medical situations. These virtual situations have been
   created based on real cases and tested on mannequins by experts.
   Trainees are asked to manage specific situations according to best
   practices recommended by SC, and receive a score and a personalized
   feedback regarding their performance.
   Results: The scenario simulated in the SG is an attack on a patrol of 3
   soldiers with an improvised explosive device explosion as a result of
   which one soldier dies, one soldier is slightly stunned, and the third
   soldier experiences a leg amputation and other injuries. This scenario
   was first tested with mannequins in military simulation centers, before
   being transformed into a virtual 3D real-time scenario using a
   multi-support, multi-operating system platform, Unity. Processes of
   gamification and scoring were applied, with 2 levels of difficulty. A
   personalized debriefing was integrated at the end of the simulations.
   The design and production of the SG took 9 months. The deployment,
   performed in 3 months, has reached 84 of 96 (88\%) French Army units,
   with a total of 818 hours of connection in the first 3 months.
   Conclusions: The development of 3D-SC1 involved a collaborative platform
   with interdisciplinary actors from the French Health Service, a
   university, and videogame industry. Training each French soldier with
   simulation exercises and mannequins is challenging and costly.
   Implementation of SGs into the training program could offer a unique
   opportunity at a lower cost to improve training and subsequently the
   real-time performance of soldiers when managing combat casualties;
   ideally, these should be combined with physical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{In automotive industry, planning of manual assembly is getting
   ever-increasing complex, diverse and variant-rich due to ever-increasing
   market demands for more models and derivatives with shorter life-cycles.
   In order to reduce the costs for building physical prototypes before

   augmented reality methods for real-time assessments of manual assembly
   tasks used in interdisciplinary production planning workshops. This
   novel mixed reality assessment system unifies innovative interaction
   concepts with display technologies from a variety of domains.
   True-to-scale floor projections, interactive tangible tabletops,
   powerwalls and head mounted displays are used in combination with
   markerless full body motion capture and motion controller interfaces.
   Therewith, production planners in workshop situations are enabled to
   collaboratively plan and optimize station layouts, author 3D scenes and
   assess product and process related topics, such as buildability,
   reachability, assembly and disassembly routines. An in-depth evaluation

Journal = {{DISCOURSE PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{233-251}},
Abstract = {{People often accommodate to each other's speech by aligning their
   linguistic production with their partner's. According to an influential
   theory, the Interactive Alignment Model, alignment is the result of
   priming. When people perceive an utterance, the corresponding linguistic
   representations are primed and become easier to produce. Here we tested
   this theory by investigating whether pitch (F0) alignment shows two
   characteristic signatures of priming: dose dependence and persistence.
   In a virtual reality experiment, we manipulated the pitch of a virtual
   interlocutor's speech to find out (1) whether participants accommodated
   to the agent's F0, (2) whether the amount of accommodation increased
   with increasing exposure to the agent's speech, and (3) whether changes
   to participants' F0 persisted beyond the conversation. Participants
   accommodated to the virtual interlocutor, but accommodation did not
   increase in strength over the conversation and disappeared immediately
   after the conversation ended. Results argue against a priming-based
   account of F0 accommodation and indicate that an alternative mechanism
   is needed to explain alignment along continuous dimensions of language
   such as speech rate and pitch.}},

Abstract = {{The arc welding process has a substantially complex nature, making it a
   difficult and specialized work. In this paper, is proposed the use of a
   haptic interface in an Off-Line Programming (OLP) system for a welding
   robot, which allows the planning and programming of welding paths.
   The traditional techniques used for teaching routes to be followed by
   the robot to perform its task, involving manual repetitions are risky,
   slow and disruptive to the production process. In this regard, the
   Virtual Reality (VR) and OLP techniques offer several advantages and
   emerge as an attractive option to define an integrated industrial
   production process. The VR technology is currently used as a teaching
   tool in a number of different application areas, where the 3D
   simulations are realistic and accurate thanks to its highly visual and
   multisensory approach.
   Meanwhile, the haptic interface it pretends to facilitate user
   interaction with the 3D environment, the user will feel in his hand the
   contact of the virtual torch with the virtual plates to be welded, in
   such a way that the positioning of the torch becomes intuitive and does
   not need a previous knowledge of desired operational coordinates or
   geometric patterns.
   In addition, this can be very useful for students and other users for
   learning the arc welding process. The development of 3D learning
   environments favors the generation and acquisition of new knowledge,
   protecting the use of real equipment.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary maker culture, the rise of technology based DIY tinkering
   and production, fails to extend beyond the representational and empower
   contemporary students to explore, create, and ultimately innovate. Its
   mainstream accessibility has diluted much of the potential for
   innovation in education. That advanced technologies in Industry 4.0 have
   afforded designers a seamless ability to translate virtual ideas to
   tangible reality has since been diminished by the restrictions in the
   idiosyncrasies of the tools of production as well as the lackluster
   application in educational contexts. Where generations of students
   learned about applied technologies, assemblies, and production in
   workshops, there is a growing disconnect between students' awareness
   between reality of industry and theory dispensed with in the classroom.
   For all the 3D printing, photorealistic imagery, and DIY gadgetry that
   maker culture has provided this current generation of designers, there
   remains a great deal of uncertainty on scaling ideas to real world
   adoption. Though still at the early part of the adoption curve, maker
   culture is at odds with the environmental, social, and ecological
   paradigms educators, and society as a whole, embrace.
   Many makers are effectively creating trinkets. Rather than truly
   fabricating full scale prototypes, many designers are content with
   producing scaled representational models on account of cost or size
   constraints of 3D printers or CNC routers, the novelty of these
   technologies, to students and faculty alike, has started to wane as
   their use is relegated to reproduction of shared assets from the
   Internet. That maker culture apologists downplay the ecological impacts
   and expenses incurred in their outputs while simultaneously amplify the
   innovations that arise from downloading shared online content is a
   pervasive sentiment educators must clarify for students. The
   accessibility and open sharing of content, capacity is to fabricate
   ideas, and current supportive reception and encouragement of innovation
   at a global scale are vital, yet there is a need for educators to
   leverage the capacity of maker culture to go beyond the
   representational. This paper outlines key strategies that educators may
   adopt in refining and sustaining a maker culture that better sustains
   innovation and pedagogical value.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing accessibility of computation and fabrication technologies
   in 21st century, ranging from advanced parametric modeling to 3D
   printing, have dramatically altered the landscape of design education in
   providing a nearly boundless productivity plain of design
   representation. This Third Industrial Revolution is a function of the
   confluence of increasing computational power and diminishing learning
   curves and technological barriers. Though this accessibility of
   technology has empowered emerging designers with the liberty to free
   themselves of conventional design tropes and investigate innovative
   ideas, the ease of generating imagery and physical representations of
   fantastic concepts has only widened the pedagogical gap between
   theoretical, academic pursuits and feasible projects for built reality.
   As digital design tools gain ubiquity in contemporary academic settings,
   a pedagogical framework must be established to ensure students can
   leverage the incredible potential these tools hold as channels for
   bridging conceptual innovation to application in the real world.
   D'Arcy Thompson's seminal work, ``On Growth and Form{''}, in the early
   20th century proposed a complement to Darwinism as it outlined a
   holistic view of interconnected systems the ultimately dictate the
   unique forms found in biological structures. If Darwin's natural
   selection serves as an analog for the iterative, conceptual design
   process, then Thompson's structuralism serves as a basis for designers
   to develop their ideas beyond the virtual and representational into
   tangible reality. The authors of this paper posit five key tenets of a
   design pedagogy ``structuralism{''} that educators may use to drive
   design innovation without compromising feasibility. These would include
   a project's: a) physical constraints and natural forces, b) internal
   capacity and context, c) external stimuli and response, d) production

   welding parameters: arc length, position, work angle, travel angle, and
   travel speed. The virtual reality welding simulator was able to evaluate
   performance, but it could not distinguish between experienced and
   trained novice welders. On average, experienced welders as a group
   scored 10 quality points higher than trained novice welders. Welding
   experience also had a large to very large effect on the quality score
   for each weld type. One identified trend for both experienced and

   (EDF), is invested in the scaling-up of tools and methods of as-built
   virtual reality for whole buildings and large audiences. In this paper,
   we first present the state of the art of scanning tools and methods used
   to represent a very complex architecture. Then, we propose a methodology
   and assess it in a large experiment carried out on the most complex
   building of a 1300-megawatt power plant, an 11-floor reactor building.
   We also present several developments that made possible the acquisition,
   processing and georeferencing of multiple data sources (1000+ 3D laser
   scans and RGB panoramic, total-station surveying, 2D floor plans and the
   3D reconstruction of CAD as-built models). In addition, we introduce new
   concepts for user interaction with complex architecture, elaborated
   during the development of an application that allows a painless
   exploration of the whole dataset by professionals, unfamiliar with such
   data types. Finally, we discuss the main feedback items from this large
   experiment, the remaining issues for the generalization of such
   large-scale surveys and the future technical and scientific challenges
   in the field of industrial virtual reality.}},

Abstract = {{Due to advances in rendering techniques and hardware capability,
   stereoscopic 3D (s3D) visualization is becoming increasingly common in
   daily life. However, this does not change the fact that stereo effects
   and visual comfort depend greatly on how the related parameters are
   controlled during the production of the s3D images. In geo-virtual
   reality systems, which are important browsers for Digital Earth, the
   maintenance of these parameters is deeply related to the navigation
   process. Therefore, the navigation method in such systems requires
   special care. This paper presents a new flying method based on a Cubemap
   structure. The method defines a Vehicle model and modifies the original
   Cubemap structure by adding a front view camera during the navigation;
   it allows the users to fly through a virtual geographic environment with
   automatic speed control, smooth collision resolution, and dynamic
   adjustment of the s3D-related parameters. A user test was conducted to
   compare this new method with the original method based on the Cubemap
   structure. The results show that the new method performs better than the
   former one for it provides a convenient interaction experience with
   improved stereoscopic effect, and diminishes visual discomfort.}},

Abstract = {{As the technology improves and their cost decreases, tabletop computers
   and their inherent ability to promote collaboration amongst users are
   gaining in popularity. Their use in virtual reality-based applications
   including virtual training environments and gaming where multi-user
   interactions are common is poised to grow. However, before tabletop
   computers become widely accepted, there are many questions with respect
   to spatial sound production and reception for these devices that need to
   be addressed. Previous work (Lam et al. in ACM Comput Entertain 12(2):
   4: 1-4: 19, 2014) has seen the development of loudspeaker-based
   amplitude panning spatial sound techniques to spatialize a sound to a
   position on a plane just above a tabletop computer's (horizontal)
   surface. Although it has been established that the localization of these
   virtual sources is prone to error, there is a lack of ground truth
   (reference) data with which to compare these earlier results. Here, we
   present the results of an experiment that measured sound localization of
   an actual sound source on a horizontal surface, thus providing such
   ground truth data. This ground truth data were then compared with the
   results of previous amplitude panning-based spatial sound techniques for
   tabletop computing displays. Preliminary results reveal that no
   substantial differences exist between previous amplitude panning results
   and the ground truth data reported here, indicating that amplitude
   panning is a viable spatial sound technique for tabletop computing and
   horizontal displays in general.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate temperature control of brain tissue during hypothermia
   treatment is necessary in order to prevent secondary brain damage and to
   avoid various side effects. Thus, the visualization of the intracerebral
   temperature distribution in hypothermia treatment was studied at the
   fundamental level. For this purpose a virtual reality technology was
   used to create a mathematical model that reflects metabolic heat
   production and Fourier heat conduction in a brain with the necessary
   parameters based on various clinical models. In the present study, an
   experimental system was developed to examine a mathematical simulation
   of the blood flow in a human head by using a solid brain model
   constructed using silicon rubber in the shape of a brain based on MRI
   data, taking into account the metabolic heat given off by three film
   heaters and including six sensors for the measurement of regional brain
   temperature. The mathematical simulation describes the internal
   temperature distribution in a brain with a similar structure to the
   brain solid model. The results of mathematical simulations and
   experiments using the brain solid model were quite consistent in the
   steady state, including control of regional temperature. This allows for
   the performance of heat conduction experiments under conditions similar
   to those of a living body, in which the internal temperature is
   clinically difficult to observe. Thus, the mathematical simulation is
   confirmed to be useful together with experiments using the solid model
   for the study of future brain hypothermia treatment.}},

Abstract = {{What does virtual water conceal? This article synthesizes political
   ecology with ecological economics to question the understanding of the
   scientific concept of virtual water as part of an independent objective

   The discourse promoting both the concept of virtual water and the
   methodologies used to estimate virtual water flows is structured
   according to some underlying ideas that are framed within market logic
   and the rationality of international trade. Consequently, it produces a
   representation of water as a factor of production that does not
   challenge the hegemonic construction of water scarcity in nature, and
   proposes a water management system the main purpose of which is to
   maximize efficiency in the use of the resource. We reveal the ideas
   underlying the virtual water concept to show how a critical approach to
   ecological economics can be complemented by political ecology theories.
   In this article, we use epistemological reflection as a starting point,
   with the specific objective of contrasting this reflection with the
   reality of water in the horticultural sector of Almeria (southern
   Spain), in order to bring to light those aspects made invisible through
   the use of the virtual water indicator in a concrete case study.}},

Abstract = {{When guiding a remote collaborator in a virtual environment, people
   often take an addressee-perspective, which may have a high cognitive
   cost. In order to improve collaborative virtual environments, a better
   understanding of how operators share spatial information is needed. This
   work aimed to study the cognitive workload linked to spatial statements
   production in situations in which the relative positions of speaker,
   addressee and target were varied. Twenty-two participants were asked to
   give-in one go-instructions to a virtual collaborator on how to find a
   target in a 3D environment. The scene showed an avatar in the center of
   eight tables. Sixty-four configurations of avatar orientation (eight
   possibilities) and target location (on the eight tables) were tested. We
   measured the delay in starting the instruction once the target appeared,
   the instruction duration and the subjective evaluation of mental demand.
   Each instruction was classified according to the spatial reference frame
   used. The delay was influenced by the processing of spatial information
   in egocentered and addressee-centered reference frames. All subsequent
   measures were determined by mental transformations in addressee-centered
   coordinates. One condition in particular, when the target was situated
   diagonally behind the addressee, gave rise to a higher mental demand for
   the speaker, which points to the investment made by the speaker in
   achieving the least collaborative effort. Further work should seek to
   develop efficient tools to facilitate spatial communication in
   situations that induce the most mental workload.}},

Abstract = {{In JoVE Environment, we've had a pretty warm summer in the northern
   hemisphere, so we can't help but think about all the greenhouse gases in
   our atmosphere that keep our planet nice and warm. These days, livestock
   are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane.
   Livestock contribute anywhere from 7 to 18\% of global
   emissions-depending on who you ask. Naturally, climate scientists are
   interested in controlling enteric methane from livestock. This requires
   accurate and precise measurement techniques, so Hristov et al. present a
   method using the Automated Head-Chamber System (AHCS), which monitors
   methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) mass fluxes from the breath of
   ruminant animals (e.g., cattle). This system produces repeatable and
   accurate emission results, and can help efforts to curb greenhouse gas
   emissions.
   In JoVE Environment, we're also concerned about herbicide resistance in
   weeds, which poses a serious threat to food and fiber production. Plants
   can gain resistance to herbicides through genetic mutations or through
   enhanced activity of enzymes that metabolize and detoxify chemicals. In
   order to determine rates of herbicide metabolism in certain weeds, Ma et
   al. developed an excised leaf assay, which allows them to take
   experiments from the greenhouse into the lab so they can perform
   radiolabeled herbicide experiments more efficiently. As more and more
   plants become resistant to herbicides, this method will be useful for
   investigating the metabolic basis of herbicide resistance.
   In JoVE Bioengineering, one of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering
   is to regenerate large bone defects using synthetic scaffolds or
   templates. Most available scaffolds don't allow appreciable cell
   infiltration or distribution to achieve significant bone regeneration,
   so Oh et al. have developed a highly porous bone-like template with
   micro-channels and nanopores. Cells can be seeded into the biogenic
   templates through capillary action, and grow to confluence within days.
   This concept can help advance the repair of large bone defects. In JoVE
   Behavior, the human neuromuscular junction can be studied using a
   variety of noninvasive techniques, including electromyography (EMG), 3D
   motion capture, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. This month,
   Talkington et al. add the unique aspect of virtual reality to this test
   battery, and describe a customizable circuit that synchronizes data
   sampled from all of these techniques.

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Chroma-keying is a technique used to replace solid-colored background of
   images or video frames. This technique is widely used in TV
   broadcasting, film production, augmented reality, and virtual
   environment. This paper proposes a new chroma-keying method, which can
   automatically remove the background color in an image and accurately
   segment the foreground objects along with their transparency property.
   Compared to conventional chroma-keying methods based on color
   clustering, color difference, or thresholding, the proposed method
   analyzes the color statistics and color confidence of the image in
   global range. By analyzing image color statistics, local lightness
   variation, and experience from human visual perception in HSV color
   space, a segmentation map called quadmap is automatically generated to
   segment the image into four types of regions: 1) foreground; 2)
   background; 3) transparent; and 4) reflective regions. By using quadmap,
   the proposed chroma-keying system can differentiate between transparent
   and reflective regions. This has always been a challenging problem in
   conventional chroma-keying or a matting systems. This improvement
   generates more reliable foreground colors in reflective regions. As a
   result, there can be less constrains for foreground scene used in
   TV-broadcasting or film making. The procedures of the proposed method
   consist of the following five steps: 1) background region detection
   based on color statistics and local lightness variation; 2) absolute
   foreground region detection based on the knowledge of background color
   and predefined thresholds in Hue channel of HSV color space; 3)
   reflective region detection based on experience from human visual
   system; 4) background color propagation based on Laplacian equation; and
   5) transparency value and foreground color estimation based on global
   sampling and color confidence.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in computer technology nowadays, the virtual

   design. In this study, a virtual reality system of casting production
   process named VR-Casting has been developed. The full range of virtual

   introduced in this paper, such as a novel network running environment,
   the latest Web3D drawing standard named WebGL, levels of detail
   technology used for rendering on demand, and the detection and updating
   technology in the casting motions. Based on the above technologies,
   different 3D models and the virtual panoramic scene were established.
   Motion schema and user interface of the casting process was delicately
   designed to enable the system a better interactivity. The latest
   internet graphics standard WebGL was used to render the models. As
   VR-Casting is characterized as lightweight and cross-platform, it offers
   access to the visualization for various platforms and devices. The
   demonstration delivers VR-Casting has a broad application prospect like
   exhibition, education, training, and process analysis. Some tests were
   implemented on different devices, and the results demonstrated
   VR-Casting has a splendid performance when conducting tests on rendering
   models. When using VR-Casting, observer has a certain sense of immersion
   with arbitrarily adjusting of the observation angle and even watches
   deeply into the interior of the casts. Thus, observer can master the
   details in a more comprehensive and diverse way during the casting

   modeling builds digital models with real-world physical fidelity, not
   just appearance, as the goal. This type of modeling has been widely
   adopted by mechanical engineers, architects, and other engineering-based
   fields concerned with the production of mathematically accurate computer
   models of real world objects. Most importantly, solid models simulate
   mass, a key property that most digital archaeological models to date
   lack. As a result, material properties such as density, compressive and
   tensile strengths, and shear modulus can be applied to solid models to
   make them as close to physical reality as possible. Furthermore, working
   assemblies of many parts can be created and operated with realistic
   performance. This enables a range of simulation and testing
   possibilities including finite element analysis, which can evaluate
   models under operational conditions. Despite the accessibility of solid
   modeling software and range of potential applications, it has seen
   little adoption by the archaeological community. This paper describes
   the creation of digital solid models to virtually recover and analyze
   the methods of naval architecture used to design the hull of Vasa, a
   Swedish warship that sunk in 1628. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A land use many-objective optimization problem for a 1500-ha farm with
   315 paddocks was formulated with 14 objectives (maximizing sawlog
   production, pulpwood production, milksolids, beef, sheep meat, wool,
   carbon sequestration, water production, income and Earnings Before
   Interest and Tax; and minimizing costs, nitrate leaching, phosphorus
   loss and sedimentation). This was solved using a modified
   Reference-point-based Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II
   augmented by simulated epigenetic operations. The search space had
   complex variable interactions and was based on economic data and several
   interoperating simulation models. The solution was an approximation of a
   Hyperspace Pareto Frontier (HPF), where each non-dominated trade-off
   point represented a set of land-use management actions taken within a
   10-year period and their related management options, spanning a planning
   period of 50 years. A trade-off analysis was achieved using Hyper-Radial
   Visualization (HRV) by collapsing the HPF into a 2-D visualization
   capability through an interactive virtual reality (VR)-based method,
   thereby facilitating intuitive selection of a sound compromise solution
   dictated by the decision makers' preferences under uncertainty
   conditions. Four scenarios of the HRV were considered emphasizing
   economic, sedimentation and nitrate leaching aspects-giving rise to a
   triple bottomline (i.e. the economic, environmental and social complex,
   where the social aspect is represented by the preferences of the various
   stakeholders). Highlights of the proposed approach are the development
   of an innovative epigenetics-based multi-objective optimizer,
   uncertainty incorporation in the search space data and decision making
   on a multi-dimensional space through a VR-simulation-based visual
   steering process controlled at its core by a multi-criterion decision
   making-based process. This approach has widespread applicability to many
   other `wicked' societal problem-solving tasks. Copyright (C) 2014 John

Abstract = {{The quest of developing realistic facial animation is ever-growing. The
   emergence of sophisticated algorithms, new graphical user interfaces,
   laser scans and advanced 3D tools imparted further impetus towards the
   rapid advancement of complex virtual human facialmodel. Face-to-face
   communication being the most natural way of human interaction, the
   facial animation systems became more attractive in the information
   technology era for sundry applications. The production of
   computer-animated movies using synthetic actors are still challenging
   issues. Proposed facial expression carries the signature of happiness,
   sadness, angry or cheerful, etc. The mood of a particular person in the
   midst of a large group can immediately be identified via very subtle
   changes in facial expressions. Facial expressions being very complex as
   well as important nonverbal communication channel are tricky to
   synthesize realistically using computer graphics. Computer synthesis of
   practical facial expressions must deal with the geometric representation
   of the human face and the control of the facial animation. We developed
   a new approach by integrating blend shape interpolation (BSI) and facial
   action coding system(FACS) to create a realistic and expressive computer
   facial animation design. The BSI is used to generate the natural face
   while the FACS is employed to reflect the exact facial muscle movements
   for four basic natural emotional expressions such as angry, happy, sad
   and fear with high fidelity. The results in perceiving the realistic
   facial expression for virtual human emotions based on facial skin color
   and texture may contribute towards the development of virtual reality
   and game environment of computer aided graphics animation systems.

Abstract = {{Robots play an important role in performing operations such as welding,
   drilling and screwing parts in manufacturing. Optimizing the robot arm
   movement time between different points is an important task which will
   minimize the make-span and maximize the production rate. But robot
   programming is a complex task whereby the user needs to teach and
   control the robot in order to perform a desired action. In order to
   address the above problem, an integrated 3-dimensional (3D) simulation
   software and virtual reality (VR) system is developed to simplify and
   speed up tasks and therefore enhance the quality of manufacturing
   processes. This system has the capability to communicate, transfer,
   optimize and test the data obtained from the VR and 3D environment to
   the real robot in a fast and efficient manner. In addition, this system
   eliminates the need for robot programming, and thus it is easily
   implemented by users with limited engineering knowledge. The
   optimization model is tested on a test case, in which the data are
   extracted from the VR system. The results show an increase in production
   rate and a decrease in cycle time when the make-span is minimized. The
   virtual reality robotic teaching system (VRRTS) offers several benefits
   to users, and will therefore surpass complex and time-intensive
   conventional robot programming methods.}},

Pages = {{30-40}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A natural consequence of the extended use of CAD systems for the design
   and production of any kind of vessel is its use in Virtual Reality
   environments, mainly because now it has become an accessible technology.
   Virtual Reality is extended in every industry, in every sector, at any
   level. Important improvements both in software and hardware have had an
   important impact in its use in the shipbuilding industry, where it is
   necessary to handle complex ship 3D models with huge amount of data. So,
   efficiency is the base condition in the Virtual Reality navigation
   around a vessel. To enhance it, there are three important factors that
   play a fundamental role. The first one is having an appropriate CAD
   system with all the information of the ship in a single data base. The
   second important issue is to have a viewer, which is a tool that allows
   the management of the 3D model to be used in Virtual Reality
   environments. No need to say that a good integration between the viewer
   and the CAD system will be translated into more functionality and better
   performance. Finally, the third important player is hardware, which
   makes possibility the Virtual Reality navigation in many different
   environments.
   This paper describes first of all different efficient uses of Virtual
   Reality in the shipbuilding industry, taking in consideration all the
   agents involved and describing in particular the advantages for any of
   them. Regarding the software requirements, it will be described in
   particular the new FVIEWER, developed by SENER for the Virtual Reality
   navigation and design review and based on the FORAN system. From the
   hardware side, it will be described some of the most relevant and
   feasible applications of the Virtual Reality, taking in consideration
   potential uses and accessible technology in the market. The future of
   the Virtual Reality in shipbuilding will be explained after that. (C)

   Research Design}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a mixed-method research design for investigating
   complexity of social reality. The research design integrates grounded
   theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) and social simulation and is therefore
   called grounded simulation (GS). GS starts with in-depth investigations
   of complex social phenomena from perspectives of people who experience
   them. These investigations follow principles of grounded theory and
   enquire into contexts that research participants describe and the way
   they make sense of action in these contexts. Data analysis progresses
   inductively and outwards, from narratives of people who are at the
   centre of the phenomena to emerging constructs and theories. While the
   grounded theory fieldwork would have its own research outputs, its
   selected findings can be then carried to agent-based models for further
   investigation of social complexity. By representing social and economic
   agents, their contexts and actions as closely as possible, GS shortens
   the distance between research participants, who have real life
   experiences of the subject being modelled, and the virtual agents.
   Knowledge production in social simulation progresses generatively and
   upwards, moving from interactions at the individual level to emergent
   properties at the macro-level. GS experiments are thus suitable for
   studying the societal implications of meanings that emerge from the data
   collected in grounded theory. The paper illustrates how this research
   design can be used, by referring to a GS study on diffusion of
   innovations.}},

Title = {{Landmark and route knowledge in children's spatial representation of a
   virtual environment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the development of landmark and route knowledge
   in complex wayfinding situations. It focuses on how children (aged 6, 8,
   and 10 years) and young adults (n = 79) indicate, recognize, and bind
   landmarks and directions in both verbal and visuo-spatial tasks after
   learning a virtual route. Performance in these tasks is also related to
   general verbal and visuo-spatial abilities as assessed by independent
   standardized tests (attention, working memory, perception of direction,
   production and comprehension of spatial terms, sentences and stories).
   The results first show that the quantity and quality of landmarks and
   directions produced and recognized by participants in both verbal and
   visuo-spatial tasks increased with age. In addition, an increase with
   age was observed in participants' selection of decisional landmarks
   (i.e., landmarks associated with a change of direction), as well as in
   their capacity to bind landmarks and directions. Our results support the
   view that children first acquire landmark knowledge, then route
   knowledge, as shown by their late developing ability to bind knowledge
   of directions and landmarks. Overall, the quality of verbal and
   visuo-spatial information in participants' spatial representations was
   found to vary mostly with their visuo-spatial abilities (attention and
   perception of directions) and not with their verbal abilities.
   Interestingly, however, when asked to recognize landmarks encountered
   during the route, participants show an increasing bias with age toward
   choosing a related landmark of the same category, regardless of its
   visual characteristics, i.e., they incorrectly choose the picture of
   another fountain. The discussion highlights the need for further studies
   to determine more precisely the role of verbal and visuo-spatial
   knowledge and the nature of how children learn to represent and memorize
   routes.}},

   these monuments looked like in the past. The Unity 3D (R) game
   developing environment was used for creating this application, in which
   all these models were inserted in the same file format. For the
   application two diachronic virtual tours of the Athenian Agora were
   produced. The first one illustrates the Agora as it is today and the
   second one at the 2nd century A.D. Finally the future perspective for
   the evolution of this game is presented which includes the addition of
   some questions that the user will be able to answer. Finally an
   evaluation is scheduled to be performed at the end of the project.}},

Abstract = {{Support for coordination in online spaces, specifically in peer
   production systems, has frequently been an after-thought. In the absence
   of such support, the users of such systems must work to find an emergent
   order that drives shared project goals and leads to equitable processes.
   In short, they must rely on the ``wisdom of the crowds.{''} As our study
   demonstrates, however, the reality is that often the system tools
   available for coordination, evaluation, and work articulation are not
   suitable to the task at hand. Our study, first, takes a theoretical
   approach to understanding how tool-mediated coordination functions
   within peer production systems. Secondly, we enumerate the methods
   available to identify automated and semi-automated tools that function
   within such systems by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing trace
   interactions and their utility in Wikipedia over a year-long period.
   Finally, we identify potential vacuums where new design interventions
   have the greatest potential for enhancing peer-production systems.}},

Abstract = {{Film is about engagement with the audience. Drawing the audience into a
   story so as to forget everything else for the time they are watching
   that movie requires a suspension of disbelief by the audience. Those who
   develop technology for creative purposes have had at their heart a remit
   to give filmmakers the ability to give audiences less and less reason to
   break this suspension of disbelief by creating more and more visually
   believable worlds and characters.
   The adoption of stereoscopy to the film making process has mixed reasons
   behind it. Due to the audience's fascination with this art form, the
   corporate producers saw a means to make larger amounts of money from the
   same production. Those at the more grass roots level see stereoscopy as
   a means of engaging the audience to much greater levels. In an art where
   perception is everything, audiences are being led to perceive that they
   are further into the world of the story and that the world of the story
   is coming out of the screen to meet them. But there is a limit to this.
   360-degree, stereo 3D Virtual Reality is now taking this to a much
   greater level. No longer are images in front of or behind a convergence
   plane as there is no longer a perceived screen plane. This paper's aim
   is to explore what this means, from an artistic perspective, to this
   fast moving industry.}},

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation of individuals with flaccid or severely affected upper
   extremities is challenging due to their limited motor ability and few
   options for therapeutic training. This initial study tested the
   feasibility of training individuals with severe hemiparesis using
   virtual reality (VR) based mirrored feedback and pinch force modulation
   tasks. The results demonstrated that the simulations were well tolerated
   early after stroke. Priming effects of the mirror tasks were suggested
   by increased maximal pinch force immediately after training.
   Furthermore, despite having no clinically observable movement distally,
   the subjects were able to consciously activate their muscles as shown by
   force traces and EMG recorded during the pinch trace task. Motor
   learning was also suggested by the decrease in Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE) during this task. Lastly the benefits of using objective,
   technology based measurement tools was demonstrated by the ability of
   the force sensor to detect small changes in force production that could
   not be measured with a clinical scale of impairment.}},

Abstract = {{Digital games, or their cyberspace, are becoming a new ``living
   space{''} of modern human. It is a ``virtual{''} environment in which
   the essence of human experience is transformed. ``Virtualisation{''}
   brings ``freshnese and ``uniqueness{''} of virtual worlds of digital
   games. Along with specific features of these graphical and auditory
   worlds comes also a broad extent of subjective sharing. It is
   imagination and experiencing of the mostly ``artificial{''}
   (cyber)experience of relative ``freeing{''} from the flow of (physical)
   time, including relative unbodied form or ``different body form{''} of
   the subject. They are determined by the so-called Presence and
   Immersion. Experiential production addresses digital games to the
   consumer - ``guest{''} basing on personal aspect. In a spirit of
   phenomenology, experience seen in the context of digital games is
   understood as a subjective, individual-based temporary process. Also as
   experience that is in correlation to experience brought by human life.
   Seen from the point of cultural and social expectations, the key is in
   its potential to permit meaningful experience, significant in human life
   and positively influencing quality of human life. Nowadays we reflect
   attractivity and asset, but also risks and negative features, certain
   ``price{''} that humans pays for their attachment to the cyberspace of
   digital games. A new evaluation does not lead to denial of
   (cyber)experience, but finds the importance of its complementarity. It
   is important to learn how to live in both the ``natural{''} and
   ``virtual{''} reality; this needs to be understood also as a moral
   challenge. We may take it as a pro-active step if the question of what
   constitutes ``the good{''} of experience in context of digital games is
   indeed approached in experiential production.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main problems in modern society is food waste. The main cause
   of it is the attitude of the consumers, which influence enormously the
   whole food chain, from production to consumption. Most of buyers see
   food as a commodity and, especially children, don't have any idea where
   it comes from. One way to reduce the problem seems to be changing
   consumers' attitude, which develops during the early years of childhood.
   Research has shown a change in children's food-related behavior after
   attending school garden classes. Often the experience of growing crops
   can't be done in the domestic space, thus causing a loss of the positive
   effects in the long term. This paper presents a project that tries to
   teach children how to grow their own food indoor and outdoor, mixing
   real and virtual reality, connecting something natural as a plant to the
   Internet of Things (network of physical objects virtually connected to
   each other and to the web). The use of sensors related to an app makes
   it more fun and educational. The aim of the project is to change
   children's attitude towards food, increasing their knowledge about
   production and consumption in order to reduce waste in the future. The
   research has been in collaboration with Cisco NL and MediaLAB Amsterdam.
   The user testing has been executed in Amsterdam, with Dutch children.}},

Abstract = {{The Oil \& Gas industry have been focusing on robots to accomplish
   several offshore activities as a way to diminish production costs,
   replace workers during hazardous operational procedures, enabling
   exploration in remote places and, in particular, deep-water regions. The
   project and validation of a robotic task on a virtual environment aids
   studies on how to introduce robots in these environments in an efficient
   way and, when compared to actual tests, significantly reduce costs and
   help to mitigate operational risks. In this context, we present
   SimVR-Robotics, a virtual reality tool to plan, simulate and evaluate
   the use of robots on offshore scenarios. SimVR-Robotics is capable to
   recreate realistic environments and to reproduce accurately physics with
   multiple robots. The user can create complex scenes from a model library
   and simulate them in real time or, if desired, use the graphic editor to
   create and configure its own robot. Several components are provided to
   view the simulation data, control the robots and objects in the scene,
   and assess the feasibility of the projected scenarios. In addition, the
   software offers, to advanced users, access to its internal API to
   control the various components of the scene. As the tool is based on the
   ROS (Robot Operating System), it is extremely easy to integrate with
   other external simulators. In this article, we discuss the
   SimVR-Robotics architecture, as well as its most important resources. To
   illustrate its benefits, present two real applications: a trajectory
   study of a robotic arm and planning an underwater operation using an ROV
   (Remote Operated Vehicle).}},

   different sources. As a result, a tablet PC application was implemented,
   which allows displaying maintenance information as well as live plant
   process data in the form of augmented reality. More than 100 of those
   sticky notes can be placed using this system, whereas each note requires
   a file size of 12 to 16 kilo bytes. After placing a sticky note, the
   system recognizes it even if the camera's position is not exactly the
   same as during the placing process.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to reflect on a more conscious production
   and consumption of water. This issue is closely linked to the
   responsibilities towards this liquid, which is so precious to life on
   Earth. Thus, a person can simply play the role of consumer, paying for
   the product and running out of it without worrying about the future.
   However, individuals may also take the role of active citizens in water
   consumption, which in turn influences resilient actions in the
   exploration and use of this resource by companies, as well as throughout
   society. Regarding the aspects related to water use and production, it
   is necessary to discuss their addition to products circulating in the
   market, especially through commodities, by using the concept of
   ``virtual water{''}. This fact is relevant because although Earth has
   two thirds of its surface covered in water, it is known that one in
   three people do not have it in sufficient quantities to meet their basic
   needs (SALVADOR; DWECK, 2008), hence the importance of evaluating the
   use of virtual water, production, and consumer behavior. Thus, the
   exploratory method with qualitative approach is appropriate to
   facilitate the understanding of the studied social reality. Based on
   analytical categories regarding the aware production and consumption of
   water, we analyze specific cases in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and highlight
   that the consumption of this product has changed the industry's behavior
   and individuals influenced by its scarcity. It is assumed, at the end of
   this research, that even if people decide to consume water without
   worrying about other people, they will be affected as citizens. Thus,
   the right to consume does not absolve individuals of responsibility as
   citizens, which is also true for companies that suffer from changes in
   the availability of this resource.}},

Abstract = {{In Classical Greece the design and construction of buildings were
   interconnected, forming a single activity. With the development of
   knowledge and technology, this process has fragmented, giving rise to
   different activities, performed by various professionals, such as the
   architect, the engineer and the builder, leading to problems related
   with information exchange between them. With the research projects
   Tecton and Technos, we intend to reunite these activities again, seeking
   to simplify the building production process. In Tecton, we propose an
   Immersive Virtual Reality Environment to sketch and model objects in an
   interactive way, using hand gestures and body postures, enabling
   architects to change between the viewpoint of the creator and that of
   the user, thereby designing buildings while experiencing them at
   full-scale at the same time. In the future Technos project, our vision
   is develop detailed 3D virtual models to serve both as supporting
   elements for the digital fabrication of building parts and as
   communications elements for the assembly and construction of buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Serious games are growing more and more in the context of lifelong
   training and initial education. They cover several areas (human science,
   engineering science, life science,...) that are used for industrial or
   academic purposes. However, some fields induce specific issues. Thus, in
   the industrial area, the constraints inherent to the activity impact the
   development of a scenario and implementation of a serious gaming
   environment. Indeed, the objective of the industry training must both
   lead to the acquisition of knowledge and the transfer of skills.
   Moreover, the actual validation of these skills is paramount especially
   if their uses are located on an industrial site, where there are often
   risks associated with the security of persons and equipment. In many
   industries, some regulatory constraints impose an obligation of means
   for the training of staff. In the sector of production, the
   proliferation of interim requires inevitably targeted training. Finally,
   it should be noted that even for permanent staff, alternation and
   fragmentation of training periods seriously complicate the deep learning
   task. Finally, we can wonder if the serious game can bring relevant
   answers to specific problems of training in an industrial context? This
   article offers some answers to this question. Thus, in this work, we
   propose a serious game scripting framework adapted to the industrial
   context. This scripting framework is structured around two approaches:
   the first defines a global framework for scheduling a fun or playful
   scenario. Moreover, this framework allows to take into account the
   phases of availability of learners while maintaining motivation. The
   second approach defines an immersive framework for validating acquired
   and security compliance that is based on two complementary purposes: Use
   of alternate observation activities (games / real) and an immersive
   simulation (Virtual Reality) for security. In partnership with a company
   in the steel industry, we have developed a prototype of serious game in
   order to implement this scripting framework. The prototype is based on a
   generic game platform, on a tablet with use of RFID tag, and with an
   immersive virtual reality Head-Mounted-Display (HMD type Oculus). In
   this article we will present the actions realized in the context of a
   professional activity related to the manipulation of a bridge crane.}},

Abstract = {{In the field of engineering, the best results can be obtained if we are
   able to interact with our models. Customers generally want to interact
   with models or designs for new products, so we are developing various
   alternatives for visualization, such as Virtual and Augmented Realities
   based on accurate models with no need of using specific software. In
   order to have a better and global knowledge of the various
   possibilities, in this paper we show the situation and capabilities of
   these technologies. From models developed with commercial programs and
   tools for industrial design, we propose a workflow to give everybody a
   chance to interact with these models. The sectors where these
   technologies are applied and the services offered are grouped together
   in industrial production systems and learning of related disciplines.

Abstract = {{In the Poznan University of Technology Chair of Production Engineering
   and Management, a Virtual Reality - Rapid Prototyping team has been
   active for many years and one of the studied activities is possibility
   of VR use in classes for higher education. As a result of cooperation
   with one of the medical universities in the region, an educational
   application has been developed, as a didactic aid during anatomy,
   physiology and pathology courses. During the test use, the application
   has been found quite interesting for both the lecturers and the
   students. It allowed, among other things, to freely slice the virtual
   human body and showing and hiding selected groups of organs, in order to
   allow detailed inspection of human anatomy by the user. This work
   continues in the study presented in this paper - they are aimed at
   expanding the simulation functionalities and allowing to conduct a
   training for the ultrasound examination. In many previous studies, it
   was proven that possibility of tracking the user's movements allows the
   simulation realism to be improved. It is a result of the phenomenon of
   immersion of the user in the virtual world. The immersion improves
   quality of the conducted virtual training and allows to better use the
   abilities learned during the course. In case of the ultrasound scanner,
   it is necessary to track both the position and the orientation of the
   device head, for proper generation of the virtual image of the insides
   of the human body. The paper discusses a process of adaptation of a head
   used in the ultrasound scan to application in the training simulation.
   Process of preparation and adaptation of the head geometry was
   described, along with a process of preparation of virtual and then
   physical prototypes using the 3D Printing technology. The prepared
   prototypes were covered with markers of the optical tracking system.
   Proper arrangement of the markers was implemented in the database and
   scenarios of work were prepared, to check correctness of gathering
   information about the ultrasound scanner head orientation and position
   in the three-dimensional space. Developed solutions were verified on a
   test group of users. Obtained results were presented in a form allowing
   their easy interpretation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Manufacturing industry is facing important challenges in terms of
   sustainability, flexibility, ramp-up and time-to-market shortening. This
   is pushing RTD towards digital tools and methods to simulate and test
   production processes before-hand and thus bridging the gaps between
   manufacturing engineering and production. For example, virtual training
   offers a huge potential to reduce the time and effort of traditional
   hardware training and thus leading to shorter production ramp-up time.
   However, before being deployed in an industrial environment, virtual
   training systems need to prove their reliability and user acceptance.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of gaming
   experience on the learning process of a manufacturing operation using
   the VIrtual Simulation and TRAining (VISTRA) system, a serious game that
   simulates manufacturing environments in order to train operators to
   perform manual tasks. The simulated operations take place at a welding
   workstation for truck chassis parts, where automation and manual tasks
   are combined. The case study aims then to evaluate the impact of
   gaming-experience and the general usability of the VISTRA system. Ten
   operators participated in the study; each operator completed five
   different training scenes on three difficulty levels each. Completion
   time and mistake count were computed by the VISTRA system after
   completing each training scene. This information was analyzed and
   compared. Results showed that: (1) users without gaming experience took
   considerably more time to complete the sequences than users with gaming
   experience, (2) the same amount of mistakes were made by gamers and by
   no-gamers, and (3) 50\% of the mistakes were made during a particular
   scene. The study thus found that gaming experience influences positively
   on training completion time using the VISTRA system. The particularities
   on the mistake count demonstrated that gaming experience does not
   influence the understanding of the manufacturing operation. Usability
   issues found on users' feedback are further discussed in terms of
   visualization, tools and parts, assisted-learning and ergonomics. (C)

Abstract = {{Manual tasks play an important role in social sustainable manufacturing
   enterprises. Commonly, manual operations are used for low volume
   productions, but are not limited to. Operational models in manufacturing
   systems based on ``x-to-order{''} paradigms (e.g. assembly-to-order) may
   require manual operations to speed-up the ramp-up time of new product
   configuration assemblies. The implications of manual operations in any
   production line may imply that any manufacturing or assembly process
   become more susceptible to human errors and therefore translate into
   delays, defects and/or poor product quality. In this scenario, virtual
   and augmented realities can offer significant advantages to support the
   human operator in manual operations. This research work presents the
   development of a mixed (virtual and augmented) reality assistance system
   that permits real-time support in manual operations. A review of mixed
   reality techniques and technologies was conducted, where it was
   determined to use a projection mapping solution for the proposed
   assistance system. According to the specific requirements of the
   demonstration environment, hardware and software components were chosen.
   The developed mixed reality assistance system was able to guide any user
   without any prior knowledge through the successful completion of the
   specific assembly task. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   data, such as spatial coordinates of source and listener, relative
   distance and relative velocity between them, room dimensions and
   potential obstacles between virtual source and listener are given as
   input to the proposed framework. Real time techniques are used for data
   processing. These techniques are fast and effective in order to achieve
   high performance requirements. The resulted sound gives the impression
   to the listener that the virtual source is part of the real environment.
   Any dynamic change of the parameters will have as a result the
   simultaneous real time change of the produced sound.}},

Abstract = {{As a kind of light-weighted and convenient tool to achieve stereoscopic
   vision, virtual reality glasses are gaining more popularity nowadays.
   For these glasses, molded plastic lenses are often adopted to handle
   both the imaging property and the cost of massive production. However,
   the as-built performance of the glass depends on both the optical design
   and the injection molding process, and maintaining the profile of the
   lens during injection molding process presents particular challenges. In
   this paper, optical design is combined with processing simulation
   analysis to obtain a design result suitable for injection molding. Based
   on the design and analysis results, different experiments are done using
   high-quality equipment to optimize the process parameters of injection
   molding. Finally, a single concave-convex lens is designed with a

   Engineering design is based on three coordinates (quality, cost,

   rapid processing capacity and interaction which are facilitated by
   computers. Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing
   (CAM) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) are common technologies and
   without their use the ambitions set out above remain utopian.
   Computer aided design is interactivity, modelling, scientific
   visualization, which get the picture and provide study models of various
   processes or phenomena inaccessible to direct observation. Engineering
   design belongs to fundamental engineering knowledge and use of
   CAD-CAM-CAE techniques with the concept of Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
   provides the designer a complete freedom of imagination, of products'
   representation regardless their complexity. It appears, therefore, the
   opportunity to apply analytical methods that provide information on
   product behaviour in different operating conditions, enabling
   anticipation and correction of errors that can occur in the production
   process. The designer is thus able to propose solutions to improve the
   technology of the production process and optimization of functional
   parameters of the product.

Abstract = {{In the article, given that understanding of the realities of the
   contemporary world largely depends on the correct interpretation of the
   relationship between culture and technology, the features of equipment,
   technology and industrial society in terms of their impact on culture.
   That refers to the need for the formulation of philosophical issues
   related to cultural analysis present stage of technological development
   as identify the nature of industrial society and its features, the
   information revolution and its impact on cultural processes in society,
   information technologies and their consequences for the development of
   culture, virtualization culture and so on.
   It is noted that, despite the thorough study of many scholars of
   technology as a determining factor of social development at different
   stages, technological civilization like the whole phenomenon, and high
   technology to date been insufficiently studied. Thus, the purpose of the
   article the cultural analysis of high technologies in the context of
   technological civilization.
   Noted that technology as vital for humankind as a universal means of
   satisfying every need, in the twentieth century. became one of the most
   important tools of culture. The basic characteristics of technology:
   technology is the artifact artificial entity specially made man;
   Technology is a tool that is always used as a means to meet the
   corresponding human needs; Technology is an independent reality, and it
   is opposed to nature, art, language, etc; technique is a specific way to
   use materials engineering, power and energy of nature; purposeful
   efficiency technology associated with the concept of technology.
   Attention is paid that difficulties analyzing the numerous and
   multifaceted interactions between society in general and technology
   fields due to the presence of different approaches to the definition of
   `'technology''. It is noted that in today's world is inseparable from
   the fundamental technique of the new parameter - metatehnology.
   Emphasized that sociocultural technology assessment, first of all,
   should provide the most optimal for society search options for further
   technological progress.
   According to the concepts V.S. Stepin, L. Mumford are values industrial
   society, including not only innovation and progress, but also a science
   that provides knowledge about the laws of change of objects and a
   special understanding of power and strength, not only the government
   man, and above all on objects. These values, according to V.S. Stepin,
   genome is a kind of technological civilization, its cultural and genetic
   code according to which it is reproduced and developed. Among the signs
   of our industrial society stated the following: it is built on certain
   values that are implemented throughout its existence; in its development
   it passes certain stages: genesis, development, prosperity, decline and
   death; within industrial society exist extraneous group with its own
   culture, which does not coincide with the basic culture of civilization.
   It is noted that the end of the twentieth century. to change the trend
   towards mechanization of any information flows came another: the
   evolution of software and hardware goes, but it has played a secondary
   role, and the human component of human-machine systems becomes decisive,
   because the fore social communication and organization of human
   activity. Among those singled out information technologies Humanities
   Technology (political, educational, etc.), computer simulation and data
   processing, as well as technologies that produce different types of
   virtual reality. They act as an effective way of implementing complex
   and multidimensional inner world of the modern individual.
   Emphasized that information technology is a component of spiritual
   culture, and, of course, have a semiotic nature; At the same time their
   technical features, such as instrumental and artificiality are often
   sidelined. This interpenetration of technology and culture, according to
   the author, the need for modification leads to culture in general, and
   as a result, there is a gradual change in the basic constants of human
   existence.
   The article also says these so-called high technology, the creation of
   which is a further development of the idea of the classic era of
   high-tech industry and STR is a single process consisting of three
   stages: 1) the discovery of innovative theoretical principles; 2) the
   creation of a prototype and implementation of technological tests; 3)
   constructive revision and organization of mass production of the new
   product. Determined their specific characteristics: 1) they initially
   focused on the integration of all components of technical operations in
   a single system, which also includes process control and quality
   control; 2) the extent of the functioning of material, energy and
   information flows is usually not possible to describe standard for a
   particular industry laws, therefore need new performance criteria; 3)
   high-tech products can quite easily integrate into surrounding human
   technosphere, so developers deploy their goals marketing campaigns to
   their proposed products meet the most advanced preferences `'universal
   consumer society.'' It is typical for high technology fast enough and
   significant socio-cultural effect. In addition, high-tech self-initiate
   cultural effects of which can not be predicted in advance.
   The conclusions noted that technology is an important tool of culture,
   though it is trying to replace, and the suitability of technology for
   society depends on the culture that puts technology boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Internet of Things in Manufacturing{''} (IoT-M) today is
   considered to have a disruptive impact {[}1] on industrial processes, on
   value chains and thus on the strategic challenges for the manufacturing
   industry. In this context, quite a few buzzwords are often heard. The
   most important among them are ``Cyber Physical Systems{''}, ``Smart
   Production/Manufacturing/Factory{''} and the at least in Europe very
   commonly heard term ``Industrie 4.0{''}. Especially the derived German
   term Industrie 4.0 seems to electrify all major players in the field as
   it conveys the promise for a 4th industrial revolution based on new
   internet-based technologies and approaches. In the US, very similar
   ideas are pursued. The most visible driving force behind the various
   initiatives is the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), founded in
   March 2014 to bring together the organizations and technologies and to
   promote the ``Industrial Internet{''}. Even at the first glance it is
   obvious that the initiatives of IIC and Industrie 4.0 competitively
   pursue very similar goals.
   This paper will describe the key ideas of the Internet of Things in
   Manufacturing and will then as an overview show that eRobotic approaches
   and (virtual) testbeds are key components supporting not only the
   development of the systems but also the evaluation of proposed
   standards. We will show applications of eRobotics in the context of
   Industrie 4.0 in different fields and try to depict new key ideas.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of shadows is crucial to enhancement of images in AR
   environments. Without shadows, virtual objects would look floating over
   the scene resulting in unrealistic rendering of AR environments. Casting
   hard shadows would provide only spatial information while soft shadows
   help improve realism of AR environments. Several algorithms have been
   proposed to render realistic shadows which often incurred high
   computational costs. Little attention has been directed towards the
   balanced trade-off between shadow quality and computational costs. In
   this study, two approaches are proposed: Quadratic Spline Interpolation
   (QSI) to soften the outline of the shadow and Detail Multi-Layer (DML)
   technique to optimize the volume of computations for the generation of
   soft shadows based on real light sources. QSI estimates boarder hard
   shadow samples while DML involves three main phases: real light sources
   estimation, soft shadow production and reduction of the complexity of
   3-Dimensional objects' shadows. To be more precise, a reflective
   hemisphere is used to capture real light and to create an environment
   map. The Median Cut algorithm is implemented to locate the direction of
   real light sources on the environment map. Subsequently, the original
   hard shadows are retrieved and a sample of multilayer hard shadows is
   produced where each layer has its unique size and colour. These layers
   overlap to produce soft shadows based on the real light sources'
   directions. Finally, the Level of Details (LOD) algorithm is implemented
   to increase the efficiency of soft shadows by decreasing the complexity
   of vertex transformations. The proposed technique is tested using three
   samples of multilayer hard shadows with varying numbers of light sources
   generated from the Median Cut algorithm. The experimental results show
   that the proposed technique successfully produces realistic soft shadows
   at low computational costs.}},

   Network}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{P300, a positive event-related potential (ERP) evoked at around 300 ms
   after stimulus, can be elicited using an active or passive oddball
   paradigm. Active P300 requires a person's intentional response, whereas
   passive P300 does not require an intentional response. Passive P300 has
   been used in incommunicative patients for consciousness detection and
   brain computer interface. Active and passive P300 differ in amplitude,
   but not in latency or scalp distribution. However, no study has
   addressed the mechanism underlying the production of passive P300. In
   particular, it remains unclear whether the passive P300 shares an
   identical active P300 generating network architecture when no response
   is required. This study aims to explore the hierarchical network of
   passive sensory P300 production using dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for
   ERP and a novel virtual reality (VR)-based passive oddball paradigm.
   Moreover, we investigated the causal relationship of this passive P300
   network and the changes in connection strength to address the possible
   functional roles. A classical ERP analysis was performed to verify that
   the proposed VR-based game can reliably elicit passive P300. The DCM
   results suggested that the passive and active P300 share the same
   parietal-frontal neural network for attentional control and, underlying
   the passive network, the feed-forward modulation is stronger than the
   feed-back one. The functional role of this forward modulation may
   indicate the delivery of sensory information, automatic detection of
   differences, and stimulus-driven attentional processes involved in
   performing this passive task. To our best knowledge, this is the first
   study to address the passive P300 network. The results of this study may
   provide a reference for future clinical studies on addressing the
   network alternations under pathological states of incommunicative
   patients. However, caution is required when comparing patients' analytic
   results with this study. For example, the task presented here is not
   applicable to incommunicative patients.}},

Abstract = {{Ever since its much noticed use in the 1973 film Westworld (Michael
   Crichton, USA, 1973) CGI (computer-generated imagery) has been
   continuously altering cinematic perception of reality. One of the major
   changes concerns the production of space. Though CGI is regularly
   employed to create fantasy worlds or utopian landscapes, it is worth
   noting that more and more filmmakers are turning to it in order to
   produce contemporary landscapes of devastation brought about by an
   atomic, military, or environmental catastrophe. Films such as Wall e
   (Andrew Stanton, USA, 2008) or 9 (Shane Acker, USA, 2009) are
   symptomatic in this respect of the aesthetic importance filmmakers now
   attach to the use of CGI for the representation of devastation. This
   phenomenon, which can be described here as a new aesthetic of disaster,
   leads us to examine the concept of Traumascape in connection with
   current digital culture, and more particularly in relation to the
   cinematic virtualization of spatial reality. In our view, this
   virtualization allows for a visual exponentiation of said reality, thus
   making it ascend to the power of the Traumatic Real in which originates
   the enigmatic sublimeness of space. Generally speaking, our article
   intends to analyse the production of digital traumatic space in cinema
   and to demonstrate its novel relationship with the sublime.}},

Abstract = {{Brain hypothermia requires control of its temperature within an
   appropriate range, considering the change of body temperature over a
   long period. Various mathematical models have been used for the study of
   control and cooling capability of brain temperature in hypothermia. In
   previous models, a lumped-parameter hemisphere of uniform temperature
   has been assumed as a simplified brain model without considering the
   temperature distribution. In the present study, however, a new model is
   proposed to visualize the temperature distribution in the brain. The
   model has the approximate shape of the organs in the head based on MRI
   data, and may well reflect properties such as heat transfer
   coefficients, metabolic heat production, and heat capacity of human
   organs. The model has a pseudo-blood-flow component in which any
   temperature can be set as the initial value at the starting place of
   blood flow. Simulations using this model were performed with the
   temperature controlled by the introduction of Ringer's solution into any
   of the four arteries leading to the brain. The simulation results
   suggest that the various cooling effects are manifested in every region
   of brain, and that the temperature distribution can be known for
   applications to controlling brain temperature in a part of interest.}},

   of an Industrial Robotic Work Cell}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Traditional robotic work cell design and programming are considered
   inefficient and outdated in current industrial and market demands. In
   this research, virtual reality (VR) technology is used to improve
   human-robot interface, whereby complicated commands or programming
   knowledge is not required. The proposed solution, known as VR-based
   Programming of a Robotic Work Cell (VR-Rocell), consists of two
   sub-programmes, which are VR-Robotic Work Cell Layout (VR-RoWL) and
   VR-based Robot Teaching System (VR-RoT). VR-RoWL is developed to assign
   the layout design for an industrial robotic work cell, whereby VR-RoT is
   developed to overcome safety issues and lack of trained personnel in
   robot programming. Simple and user-friendly interfaces are designed for
   inexperienced users to generate robot commands without damaging the
   robot or interrupting the production line. The user is able to attempt
   numerous times to attain an optimum solution. A case study is conducted
   in the Robotics Laboratory to assemble an electronics casing and it is
   found that the output models are compatible with commercial software
   without loss of information. Furthermore, the generated KUKA commands
   are workable when loaded into a commercial simulator. The operation of
   the actual robotic work cell shows that the errors may be due to the
   dynamics of the KUKA robot rather than the accuracy of the generated
   programme. Therefore, it is concluded that the virtual reality based
   solution approach can be implemented in an industrial robotic work cell.}},

Abstract = {{Language and action systems are highly interlinked. A critical piece of
   evidence is that speech and its accompanying gestures are tightly

   According to the ballistic view, information exchange occurs only during
   the planning phases of gesture and speech, but the 2 systems become
   independent once their execution has been initiated. In all experiments,
   participants were required to point to and/or name a light that had just
   lit up. Virtual reality and motion tracking technologies were used to
   disrupt their gesture or speech execution. Participants delayed their
   speech onset when their gesture was disrupted. They did so even when
   their gesture was disrupted at its late phase and even when they
   received only the kinesthetic feedback of their gesture. Also,
   participants prolonged their gestures when their speech was disrupted.
   These findings support the interactive view and add new constraints on

Title = {{June 2014: This Month in JoVE-3D Virtual Navigation in the Human Brain,
   Simulation of Planet Formation, and Bioprinting Cultured Cartilage
   Grafts}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{88}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Here's a look at what's coming up in the June 2014 issue of JoVE: The
   Journal of Visualized Experiments.
   The human brain has been called the next frontier of scientific
   discovery. In coming years scientists will greatly advance our
   understanding of how the brain works, leading to new methods of
   diagnosis, prevention, and intervention for many neurological disorders.
   This month in JoVE we feature two new techniques that can help
   scientists navigate through uncharted territories of the human brain. In
   the Clinical \& Translational Medicine section, DaSilva et al. analyze
   changes in neurological processes that occur during migraine headaches.
   They scan the brain of a migraine patient using two methods: magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), which uses the magnetic properties of water
   molecules to image living tissues; and positron emission tomography
   (PET), which detects gamma rays emitted by a radionuclide tracer. The
   neuroimaging data are displayed in a special format, so through special
   shutter glasses, users can see the images in a three-dimensional,
   virtual-reality environment. This technique allows real-time interaction
   and navigation through the brains of patients with migraines, and can be
   applied to other neurological disorders such as neuralgia, depression,
   and addiction.
   In the Behavior section, Bathelt et al. map the sources of cognitive
   activities in a child's cerebral cortex. Brain activity is assessed with
   electroencephalography (EEG), which measures electrical changes caused
   by neural activity, and the sources of the EEG recordings are mapped
   using head models based on MRI scans. These maps show different cortical
   regions of activation in response to different cognitive stimuli. This
   technique can help scientists understand the foundations of complex
   cognitive skills in the developing brain.
   In JoVE Applied Physics we examine a very large developing system in a
   protocol that approximates conditions in the early Solar System so
   scientists can examine how planets form. Planet formation is thought to
   begin when microscopic dust particles accumulate to form fragile
   aggregates. Over a few thousand years, these aggregates can grow to
   around 1cm in diameter. When they collide, these aggregates may bounce
   off each other or break apart into fragments-but if the collision
   velocity is just right, the aggregates will stick to each other,
   gradually forming planets over millions of years. Blum et al. developed
   laboratory setups that generate the collision velocities thought to
   promote planet formation, and record these collisions with high-speed
   imaging. With these studies, they hope to shed light on the physical
   forces that created our Solar System.
   In the bioengineering field, 3D printing is an exciting technology with
   many potential biomedical applications ranging from printing
   microfluidic arrays for cellular assays to producing physical models of
   imaging data. It can also be used to engineer actual tissue structures,
   which Cui et al. demonstrate this month in JoVE Bioengineering. They
   convert a commercial inkjet printer into a bioprinter than can build
   tissue structures out of cells and biomaterials. They use this
   technology to print cultured cartilage grafts, which show excellent cell
   viability and production of proteoglycan, a component of connective
   tissue. This technique holds the potential to repair and regenerate
   multiple tissue types.

Title = {{Measuring Sense of Presence and User Characteristics to Predict
   Effective Training in an Online Simulated Virtual Environment}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Virtual-reality solutions have successfully been used to train
   distributed teams. This study aimed to investigate the correlation
   between user characteristics and sense of presence in an online
   virtual-reality environment where distributed teams are trained. A
   greater sense of presence has the potential to make training in the
   virtual environment more effective, leading to the formation of teams
   that perform better in a real environment. Being able to identify,
   before starting online training, those user characteristics that are
   predictors of a greater sense of presence can lead to the selection of
   trainees who would benefit most from the online simulated training.
   Methods
   This is an observational study with a retrospective postsurvey of
   participants' user characteristics and degree of sense of presence.
   Twenty-nine members from 3 Air Force National Guard Medical Service
   expeditionary medical support teams participated in an online virtual
   environment training exercise and completed the Independent Television
   Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory survey, which measures sense of
   presence and user characteristics. Nonparametric statistics were applied
   to determine the statistical significance of user characteristics to
   sense of presence.
   Results
   Comparing user characteristics to the 4 scales of the Independent
   Television Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory using Kendall tau test
   gave the following results: the user characteristics ``how often you
   play video games{''} (tau(26) = -0.458, P < 0.01) and ``television/film
   production knowledge{''} (tau(27) = -0.516, P < 0.01) were significantly
   related to negative effects. Negative effects refer to adverse
   physiologic reactions owing to the virtual environment experience such
   as dizziness, nausea, headache, and eyestrain. The user characteristic
   ``knowledge of virtual reality{''} was significantly related to
   engagement (tau(26) = 0.463, P < 0.01) and negative effects (tau(26) =
   -0.404, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   Individuals who have knowledge about virtual environments and experience
   with gaming environments report a higher sense of presence that
   indicates that they will likely benefit more from online virtual
   training. Future research studies could include a larger population of
   expeditionary medical support, and the results obtained could be used to
   create a model that predicts the level of presence based on the user
   characteristics. To maximize results and minimize costs, only those
   individuals who, based on their characteristics, are supposed to have a
   higher sense of presence and less negative effects could be selected for
   online simulated virtual environment training.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the socioeconomic and environmental changes in rural China
   from the perspective of agricultural households and developed a
   multi-agent agricultural household model for rural environmental
   management (MAREM). The MAREM model consists of four submodules: the
   agricultural household production module, the consumption module, the
   labor supply module, and the environmental assessment module. In the
   model, virtual agricultural households exist in a hypothetical village.
   Farmers follow a self-adaptive approach to learn and understand policy
   variations, in order to make relevant decisions. The model has been
   validated through simulation of actual trends (the based-on-reality
   scenario). On the basis of this scenario, we further analyzed possible
   future trends in rural environmental pollution in China. Our results
   reflect that China may enter a period of farmer income stagnation
   accompanied by a rapid deterioration in rural environmental quality.
   Ammonia emission from livestock production may become the primary
   agricultural source of air pollution, and eutrophication is calculated
   to be the major water pollution issue for the long term. Synthetic
   fertilizer application is projected to be the dominant source of total
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in aquatic system (contributing to about
   64\% and 46\% of the total discharge, respectively). Our study shows
   that MAREM is an effective tool to analyze the interactions between
   agricultural households' behavior and environmental consequences under
   specific policies in China.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid prototyping (RP) describes the customized production of solid

   fabrication technologies include stereolithography (SLA), fused
   deposition modeling (FDM), computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling,
   and, more recently, selective laser sintering (SLS). The applications of
   RP techniques for dentistry include wax pattern fabrication for dental
   prostheses, dental (facial) prostheses mold (shell) fabrication, and
   removable dental prostheses framework fabrication. In the past, a
   physical plastic shape of the removable partial denture (RPD) framework
   was produced using an RP machine, and then used as a sacrificial
   pattern. Yet with the advent of the selective laser melting (SLM)
   technique, RPD metal frameworks can be directly fabricated, thereby
   omitting the casting stage. This new approach can also generate the wax
   pattern for facial prostheses directly, thereby reducing labor-intensive
   laboratory procedures. Many people stand to benefit from these new RP
   techniques for producing various forms of dental prostheses, which in
   the near future could transform traditional prosthodontic practices.}},

Abstract = {{Existing and evolving trends and paradigms in manufacturing, such as
   mass customisation and personalisation, call for better communication
   among product-production design and customisation and production
   execution. Specifically, the lack of feedback from and to the shopfloor
   can lead to lower product quality and increased production times. In
   state-of-the-art industrial practices, the most common visual interface
   devices for communication comprise control unit terminals, TFT monitors
   mounted over work stations, as well as the growing trend of mobile PCs
   and tablets. New technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), have also
   been considered in academic research for process simulation and operator
   guidance and training. This paper proposes a novel use of AR goggles,
   coupled with other mobile devices for the communication of people,
   working on the shopfloor and in the engineering offices. The proposed
   methodology tries to address the challenges, related to the use of both
   technologies (and their respective interfaces) by presenting an

   as a fiducial marker for the positioning of a virtual screen in front of

   will support the implementation of this approach as well as to show how
   they can be integrated into the existing systems and practices. (C) 2014

   loads the cylinder head is subjected to. Assembly loads and operating
   loads considered during the virtual development process are widely
   determined by the production process which again is subject to variation
   due to certain tolerances, wear of the tooling equipment etc. As it is
   highly important to ensure the fatigue design of a cylinder head, there
   is the need for new analysis models capable of capturing every possible
   load variation.
   Within the framework of this paper the influence of different variable
   loading parameters on the cylinder head HCF margin of a heavy duty
   diesel engine will be discussed. A design of experiments (DoE) analysis
   is used together with the 3-d finite element method (FEM) for the
   investigations. Furthermore a methodology for the probabilistic
   assessment of the cylinder head HCF margin based on stochastic loading
   data is introduced. At the same time an effective methodology for the
   identification of the worst case boundary conditions for HCF analysis
   will be presented.
   With the presented probabilistic method it is possible to achieve a
   highly accurate prediction of the HCF design margin. Due to the
   probabilistic approach a better understanding of the entire system is
   possible, as the interaction between input and output parameters can be
   illustrated. Therefore HCF optimization problems can be encountered more
   effectively. Furthermore the presented methodology can be used for error
   estimation of analysis results and assessment of the result sensitivity.
   Thus, a borderline layout of the cylinder head can be achieved. Also the
   minimum input information quality, which is required for a profound HCF
   analysis, can be assessed by using the sensitivity analysis presented.
   Therefore the proposed methods enable a fast and reliable development of
   cylinder heads and other combustion engine components.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Factories are becoming popular as tangible measures to teach
   engineering methods while making use of them in an industrial-like
   environment. Their core component is usually a factory demonstrator,
   users are physically working with. For factory planning such approaches
   can hardly be adapted, due to long lasting realization phases.
   To overcome this obstacle a virtual learning factory has been developed
   whose core component is not a real factory but a digital factory model.
   Based on an exemplary product and production model participants learn
   how to use factory planning methods for a clearly defined use-case. They
   apply software tools coming from the digital factory and learn how to
   use VR-systems for validation purposes. The comprehensive digital
   planning facilitates the collaboration between multiple planning
   participants. Further extension of the approach towards distance
   collaboration and use-cases covering the whole product engineering
   process are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The aim of this paper is to propose a model to assess the
   maturity level of companies' organisational, managerial and
   technological levers for Virtual communities of practices (VCoP). The
   proposed model serves as a benchmarking tool in order to analyse an
   industry sector performance in the management activities of VCoP.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodological approach was divided
   into two main stages: (i) the development of the VCoP Maturity
   Assessment Model, and (ii) an application of such model to different
   realities (benchmarking). The model proposes the assessment of eight key
   elements to measure the company's organisational, managerial and
   technological maturity in order to find a correlation with the
   performance and business impact of the VCoPs. On the other hand, the
   performance of the VCoP is evaluated based on four main criteria:
   utility, trust, contribution and sense of belonging. After the
   development of the model, we carried out an application of it in a
   benchmarking study of six of the major Oil \& Gas global companies
   focusing on the Exploration \& Production sector of such companies.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this paper is that an
   assessment carried out by the proposed model provides an overview of the
   strengths and weaknesses of the VCoP management system, and the
   opportunity for comparison with other organisations. Moreover, the
   assessment also enables the identification of a series of potential
   actions that can be undertaken in order to improve the current status of
   the virtual communities.
   Practical implications - Our benchmarking study put in evidence the
   usefulness of the proposed model. Companies were compared and ranked in
   terms of the performance of VCoP management. Such results helped
   companies to have a clear vision of their own state in management
   practices. Moreover, the assessment helped in identifying the
   bestpractices to be shared in order to improve the overall usage of
   VCoPs within the Oil and Gas industry.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose-The purpose of this research is to develop a learning system
   architecture, based on the knowledge management supported into a valid
   platform, for a globalized production training for disabled women, based
   on their capabilities, skills, and feelings as a tacit knowledge. In
   this context it is necessary to identify a profile which needs
   interaction with the virtual words. The process is completed through the
   developing of a model based on the interaction of the participants with
   intelligent agents, using the MPML3D language and which works through a
   collaborative learning process. The results are validated in a prototype
   for being tested and discussed.
   Design/methodology/approach-Virtual worlds are part of the extensive
   field of ``shared space{''} technologies, as are Augmented Reality,
   Telepresence and Virtual Reality, all discrete spaces represented and
   executed by computers and accessed exclusively through the Internet.
   Virtual worlds have technological capabilities to support the generation
   of knowledge and collaborative learning through the interaction of
   avatars (human-controlled avatar) and these ones with intelligent agents
   (avatars controlled by a machine), developing a collaborative
   information and training system, which in turn may support a platform
   for training and production of women with physical disabilities.
   Originality/value-This research presents a model that allows women with
   physical disabilities to overcome their limitations due to physical
   constraints of the real world so they can become into productive and
   globalized persons, taking advantage from the economy of virtual worlds
   as Second Life.
   The State of the Art of the above mentioned technologies, the specific
   characteristics of women with physical disabilities and the
   characteristics of virtual worlds, can generate capabilities that enable
   a collaborative learning through the interaction with intelligent agents
   (avatars controlled by a machine), which are able to answer frequently
   asked questions to avatars (human-controlled avatar), who in turn can
   generate actions from the agents within the virtual world. These agents
   allow a permanent support without the limitations of fixed schedules,
   personalizing the training without the barriers of the traditional
   process of education.
   Practical implications-The practical implications of the model proposed
   lies in three main areas:
   Productive women who overcome physical limitations due to their
   disability.
   Learning environments, based on low-cost emerging technologies.
   Globalization of people with mobility problems even from developing
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{Back in 1970 Gene Youngblood published his book ``Expanded Cinema{''},
   undoubtedly one of the major milestones in the world of media theory. In
   the book he argues that during the late 1960 cinema and the whole
   complex of audiovisual media, reached a tipping point when the
   boundaries of the world of moving images broke down and a new visual
   reality emerged. That was the time when the videosphere appeared and the
   intermedia where born. Today, forty years later, we see another,
   somewhat similar event. The intermedia, which in the meantime evolved in
   multimedia, reached another ``Seldon crisis point{''}, and we can
   witness how the whole complex of multimedia creation, processing,
   distribution and consumption is undergoing a radical change. That change
   shall profoundly modify the world of mass media communications. The
   boundaries that until now separated different mass media are becoming
   progressively blurred and in a not so distant future they might
   completely disappear creating thus just one big media industry. In a
   surrogate social environment lonely media consumers will exchange
   interaction for communication and try to escape the harsh reality by
   immersing themselves in infinite virtual worlds of the boundless
   expanded multimedia.}},

   also discusses strategies to revise manners of direction and performing,

   aspects peculiar to technological staging.
   Through the analysis of a series of performative experiments involving
   3D real time virtual reality systems, projection mapping and reactive
   surfaces, new ways of interacting in/with performance have been
   identified. This poses a unique challenge to traditional approaches of
   learning about staging, dramaturgy acting, dance and performance design
   in the academy, all of which are altered in a fundamental manner when
   real time virtual reality is introduced as a core element of the
   performative experience. Meanwhile, various analyses, descriptions and
   theorisations of technological performance have framed up-to-date
   policies on how to approach these questions more systematically. These
   have given rise to more sophisticated notions of preparedness of
   performing arts professionals, students and researchers to confront the
   potentials of new technologies and the forms of creativity and art they
   enable. The deployment of real time Motion Capture systems and
   co-present virtual environments in an educational setting comprise a

Abstract = {{In recent years, with the development of technology of micro-display,
   advanced optics and the software and hardware, near-to-eye display (NED)
   optical system will have a wide range of potential applications in the
   fields of amusement and virtual reality. However, research on the
   evaluating image quality of this kind optical system is comparatively
   lagging behind. Although now there are some methods and equipment for
   evaluation, they can't be applied in commercial production because of
   their complex operation and inaccuracy. In this paper, an academic
   method is proposed and a Rapid Evaluation System (RES) is designed to
   evaluate the image of optical system rapidly and exactly. Firstly, a set
   of parameters that eyes are sensitive to and also express the quality of
   system should be extracted and quantized to be criterion, so the
   evaluation standards can be established. Then, some parameters can be
   detected by RES consisted of micro-display, CCD camera and computer and
   so on. By process of scaling, the measuring results of the RES are exact
   and creditable, relationship between object measurement, subjective
   evaluation and the RES will be established. After that, image quality of
   optical system can be evaluated just by detecting parameters of that.
   The RES is simple and the results of evaluation are exact and keeping
   with human vision. So the method can be used not only for optimizing
   design of optical system, but also for evaluation in commercial
   production.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of using Augmented Reality (AR) user interfaces (UIs) to create
   3D media content, such as 3D models for movies and games has been
   repeatedly suggested over the last decade. Even though the concept is
   intuitively compelling and recent technological advances have made such
   an application increasingly feasible, very little progress has been made
   towards an actual real-world application of AR in professional media
   production. To this day, no immersive 3D UI has been commonly used by
   professionals for 3D computer graphics (CG) content creation.
   In this paper, we are first to publish a requirements analysis for our
   target application in the professional domain. Based on a survey that we
   conducted with media professionals, the analysis of professional 3D CG
   software, and professional training tutorials, we identify these
   requirements and put them into the context of AR UIs. From these
   findings, we derive several interaction design principles that aim to
   address the challenges of real-world application of AR to the production
   pipeline. We implemented these in our own prototype system while
   receiving feedback from media professionals. The insights gained in the
   survey, requirements analysis, and user interface design are relevant
   for research and development aimed at creating production methods for 3D

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for measuring the magnitude and impact of
   errors in mixed reality interactions. We define the errors as
   measurements of hand placement accuracy and consistency within bimanual
   movement of an interactive virtual object.
   First, a study is presented which illustrates the amount of variability
   between the hands and the mean distance of the hands from the surfaces
   of a common virtual object. The results allow a discussion of the most
   significant factors which should be considered in the frame of
   developing realistic mixed reality interaction systems. The degree of
   error was found to be independent of interaction speed, whilst the size
   of virtual object and the position of the hands are significant.
   Second, a further study illustrates how perceptible these errors are to
   a third person viewer of the interaction (e.g. an audience member). We
   found that interaction errors arising from the overestimation of an
   object surface affected the visual credibility for the viewer
   considerably more than an underestimation of the object.
   This work is presented within the application of a real-time Interactive
   Virtual Television Studio, which offers convincing real-time interaction
   for live TV production. We believe the results and methodology presented
   here could also be applied for designing, implementing and assessing
   interaction quality in many other Mixed Reality applications.}},

   gloves which allow him to interact with virtual 3D models in the work
   area. Additional viewers can see the video stream on a projector and
   thus share the users view. Both head and hand positions are tracked from
   the HMD video stream, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and
   conductive materials on the gloves allow interaction with virtual
   objects. This system is built using Autodesk Maya - a professional 3D
   software package commonly used in the media industry - and aims to
   fulfill the requirements of professional 3D design work which we
   identified in our paper of the same title. While still an early
   prototype, it was already tested with media professionals to evaluate
   our approach.}},

Abstract = {{Remote locations such as ultra-deep water reservoirs (400 m or deeper)
   have been increasing the production complexity and logistic costs for
   Oil \& Gas industry. In such conditions, oil exploration feasibility
   depends on new technologies to optimize production efficiency. One
   possible solution to this challenge is to increase the degree of
   automation in production units. New design concepts consider the use of
   robotic devices in such scenarios. In this paper we present the use of
   virtual reality techniques in a robotics framework, SimUEP-Robotics
   (Robotics Simulator for Stationary Production Units), aimed to enable
   planning the offshore platform robotizing. SimUEP-Robotics has an
   integrated Virtual Reality Engine specially tailored to provide
   realistic visualization of large offshore scene models in an immersive
   environment. Through the use of those visualization tools it is
   possible, for example, to better understand the quality of the planned
   robot trajectory and propose new algorithms that can be further
   evaluated in the virtual environment. We argue that the validation
   process in an immersive virtual environment reduces risks and costs of
   real operation tests scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The democratization of high-end, affordable and off-the-shelf sensors
   and displays triggered an explosion in the exploration of interaction
   and projection in arts. Although mostly witnessed in interactive
   artistic installations (e.g. museums and exhibitions), performing arts
   also explore such technologies, using interaction and augmented reality
   as part of the performance. Such works often emerge from collaborations
   between artists and scientists. Despite being antonymic in appearance,
   we advocate that both fields can greatly benefit from this type of
   collaboration.
   Since 2006 the authors of this paper (from a research laboratory and a
   national ballet company) have collaborated on augmenting a ballet
   performance using a dancer's movements for interaction. We focus on
   large productions using high-end motion capture and projection systems
   to allow dancers to interact with virtual elements on an augmented stage
   in front of several hundred people. To achieve this, we introduce an
   `augmented reality engineer', whose role is to design the augmented
   reality systems and interactions according to a show's aesthetic and
   choreographic message, and to control them during the performance
   alongside light and sound technicians.
   Our last production: Debussy3.0 is an augmented ballet based on La Mer
   by Claude Debussy, featuring body interactions by one of the dancers and
   backstage interactions by the augmented reality engineer. For the first
   time, we explored 3D stereoscopy as a display technique for augmented
   reality and interaction in real-time on stage. The show was presented at
   Biarritz Casino in December 2013 in front of around 700 people.
   In this paper, we present the Debussy3.0 augmented ballet both as a
   result of the use of augmented reality in performing arts and as a
   guiding thread to provide feedback on arts-science collaboration. First,
   we will describe how the ballet was constructed aesthetically,
   technically and in its choreography. We will discuss and provide
   feedback on the use of motion capture and stereoscopy techniques in a
   live show and will then broaden the scope of discussion, providing
   feedback on art-science collaboration, the traps and benefits for both
   parties, and the positive repercussions it can bring to a laboratory
   when working on industrial projects.}},

Abstract = {{The project presented here started approximately four years ago and
   concerns the main temple of Olympia, a UNESCO world heritage site, which
   is visited by thousands of tourists nearly every day. Although Olympia
   is familiar to everybody and its monuments have been well-researched for
   more than a century, there are still many puzzles related to its history
   and remains. A new interpretation of the east pediment of the temple and
   the ensuing debate caused the reopening of the issue of the
   reconstruction. The historical setting of the temple-building was also
   reconsidered and led to a detailed study and reconstruction of the
   architecture as well. All these investigations made extensive use of
   digital technologies and are presented here as a case study for applying
   virtual reality to old problems of classical archaeology.
   The digitization of the extant fragments and a three-year project
   enabled the production of a virtual 3D reconstruction of the east
   pediment of the classical temple of Zeus. In addition, the Doric temple
   itself as well as the famous cult statue made by Pheidias were also
   reconstructed virtually, making thus the visualization of the long and
   complicated history of the entire monument possible.
   The model is highly flexible and can thus be adapted to illustrate. and
   to test different scholarly hypotheses concerning some details, e.g. the
   arrangement of the central group of the east pediment or the effects of
   different lighting conditions. It also allows the non-specialist user to
   manipulate the individual pieces of sculpture, to familiarize him- or
   herself with their original appearance and position on the building and
   finally to observe minor details and to learn more about the problems
   involved in reconstructing ancient works of art.
   A short video-summary and a CD ROM have been published, both of which
   can be used for different purposes and audiences.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most consistent challenges in business is anticipating what
   the future holds and what impact it may have on current production
   systems. The scenario technique is a well-established method for
   developing and forecasting multiple future development paths for
   companies. However, this method is mostly employed to develop and to
   support strategic long-term decisions. The core idea of the approach
   introduced in this paper is to convey the future impact of today's
   decisions on production systems to employees involved in production
   planning processes. With the help of immersive visualization, performed
   in virtual reality (VR) systems, planning participants can perceive how
   the factory must adapt to fit future demands.
   In this paper, the focus is on the fourth phase of the scenario
   technique so called scenario development and, in particular, the cross
   impact analysis. With this methodology, the interrelations, or cross
   impacts of the different basic elements are determined. The cross impact
   analysis results serve as a basis for the development of a standardized
   tool that can be used to create probable production scenarios out of
   given production systems. This standardized tool will facilitate the
   usage of the scenario technique for factory planning projects, as it
   focuses the immense diversity of future uncertainties companies are
   faced with on the factory level. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. This is an open

Abstract = {{The planning and scheduling problems of steelmaking - continuous casting
   - hot rolling (SCH) manufacturing process are hard to solve with
   traditional optimization approaches. As for the limitation of human
   ability, manual plans and schedules can not guarantee quality,
   robustness and material balance between processes. With the rapid
   development of computer simulation theories and virtual reality
   technologies, computer simulation has been becoming an effective method
   for solving complex problems and evaluating complex systems. Computer
   simulation system ofSCH manufacturing process can be used for evaluating
   quality and robustness of plans and schedules in order to find the
   weakness and bottleneck in the manufacturing process before they are
   released. In this paper, a hybrid simulation model of multi-agent and
   discrete event dynamic system (DEDS) for SCH manufacturing process is
   proposed. The general simulation procedure and computer simulation
   system framework based on the hybrid model are presented. The structure,
   attributes, functions, interfaces, communication protocols and
   negotiation mechanism of different types of agent are defined. Based on
   the hybrid simulation model, a computer simulation system for SCH
   manufacturing process is developed in C++ language. The results of
   simulation experiments using practical production data of a Chinese
   steel plant show that the simulation model and the simulation system are
   valid and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Entire shape reconstruction of dynamic objects is an important research
   subject with applications on film production, virtual reality, modeling
   and engineering. Typically, entire shape reconstruction of real objects
   is achieved by combining the outcome of objects scanned from multiple
   directions. However, due to limitations on the number of 3D sensors
   enclosing the scene, occlusions inevitably occur, causing holes to
   appear on the reconstructed surfaces. These issues are intensified if
   dynamic, moving objects are considered. Volumetric and polygonal
   approaches exist to address these problems. Most notably, exemplar-based
   polygonal methods have gained momentum due to their overall improved
   visual quality. In this paper we propose an extension to the plain
   exemplar-based technique that allows for multiple dynamic objects. With
   our method, adequate hole-filling candidates are sampled from spatial
   and temporal domains and then used to synthesize likely plausible
   surfaces with smooth boundaries for the hole regions.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{205-221}},
Abstract = {{Free-ranging livestock play a pivotal role globally in the conversion of
   plant tissue into products and services that support man's many and
   changing lifestyles. With domestication came the task of providing
   livestock with an adequate plane of nutrition while simultaneously
   managing vegetation for sustainable production. Attempting to meld these
   two seemingly opposing management goals continues to be a major focus of
   rangeland research. Demand for multiple goods and services from
   rangelands today requires that livestock production make the smallest
   possible `negative hoof-print'. Advancements in global navigation
   satellite system, geographic information systems, and
   electronic/computing technologies, coupled with improved understanding
   of animal behaviour, positions virtual fencing (VF) as an increasingly
   attractive option for managing free-ranging livestock. VF offers an
   alternative to conventional fencing by replacing physical barriers with
   sensory cues to control an animal's forward movement. Currently, audio
   and electrical stimulation are the cues employed. When VF becomes a
   commercial reality, manual labour will be replaced in large part with
   cognitive labour for real-time prescription-based livestock distribution
   management that is robust, accurate, precise and flexible. The goal is
   to manage rangeland ecosystems optimally for soils, plants, herbivores
   in addition to the plant and animal's microflora. However, maximising
   the benefits of VF will require a paradigm shift in management by using
   VF as a `virtual herder' rather than simply as a tool to manage
   livestock within static physical barriers.}},

   of Virtual Environments, with interactive information (for instance, a
   video or a document about a machine that is present in the virtual

   create for evaluation and training on a virtual factory - but generic
   enough to be applied in different contexts by non-expert users (academic
   and touristic for instance). We show some preliminary results obtained
   from two different scenarios: first a production line of a factory with
   contextualized information associated to different elements which aimed
   the training of employees. Second a testing environment, to compare and
   assess two different selection styles that were integrated in pSIVE and
   to allow different users to interact with an environment created with
   pSIVE to collect opinions about the system. The conclusions show that
   the overall satisfaction was high and the comments will be considered in
   further platform development.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new technique in the production pipeline of asset
   creation for virtual environments called Z-Depth Integration (ZeDI).
   ZeDI is intended to reduce the time required to place elements at the
   appropriate z-depth within a scene. Though ZeDI is intended for use
   primarily in two-dimensional scene composition, depth-dependent
   ``flat{''} animated objects are often critical elements of augmented and
   virtual reality applications (AR/VR). ZeDI is derived from ``deep image
   compositing{''}, a capacity implemented within the OpenEXR file format.
   In order to trick the human eye into perceiving overlapping scene
   elements as being in front of or behind one another, the developer must
   manually manipulate which pixels of an element are visible in relation
   to other objects embedded within the environment's image sequence. ZeDI
   improves on this process by providing a means for interacting with
   procedurally extracted z-depth data from a virtual environment scene. By
   streamlining the process of defining objects' depth characteristics, it
   is expected that the time and energy required for developers to create
   compelling AR/VR scenes will be reduced. In the proof of concept
   presented in this manuscript, ZeDI is implemented for pre-rendered
   virtual scene construction via an AfterEffects software plug-in.}},

Abstract = {{Character animation is important in many applications, such as video
   games, movie production, and somatosensory interaction. However, it is
   difficult to control the locomotion of a virtual character in a dynamic

   paper, we present a novel optimization strategy to improve the realism
   and stability of virtual character animation. Our trajectory
   optimization method produces lifelike motions by using the motion
   capture data. The method describes systematic computation of controllers
   that can optimize locomotion. We use center of mass (COM) control and
   foot control to enhance the sense of reality in physical movement, and
   use tracking control to maintain similarity with the reference motion.
   Experiment results demonstrate our approach is applicable by simulating
   walking motion and the optimized motion is both natural and

Abstract = {{The ``Digital Factory{''} concept is one of the key tools of success on
   the market. Today it can be treated as a highly actual issue in the
   conditions of manufacturing plants. ``Digital Factory{''} concept is a
   generic professional terminology for a comprehensive network of digital
   models, methods, techniques and tools, including simulation and
   virtual-reality visualization; which are integrated by a continuous data
   management system. The objectives of a ``Digital Factory{''} concept are
   different; for example reorganization of the production lines and
   optimization of the production through the simulation of the production
   cycle; training of the workers; working on a virtual prototype in design
   phase; virtual environment is a good network place where people can
   virtually meet to co-design the product or the production line. The
   ``Digital Factory{''} concept application has become more and more
   important for complex design of products that are tailoring for
   customers.
   This paper is divided into four main parts. In the first part, the
   literature is reviewed in the field of Digital Factory, and some basic
   and key terms are defined. In the second part, the research design and
   research methodology is described. The paper is based on an extensive
   review of secondary sources, including analysis and synthesis of
   domestic and foreign professional literary sources. The methods for
   preparation of scientific research are applied, the methods of gaining
   new data, methods of data processing. Additional methods used are the
   analysis and interpretation of the concept of ``Digital Factory{''}
   characteristics and published data. In the third part of this paper, an
   overview of the project int. Nb. 6111 entitled, Increasing Technical
   Knowledge Base and Practical Skills of Teachers and Students of the
   Institute of Industrial Engineering and Management within the concept of
   ``Digital Factory{''} is presented. This project supports new
   possibilities for cooperation and creates the networks between
   educational institutions and manufacturing enterprises within the
   ``Digital Factory{''} concept. The target groups of this project are
   qualified university teachers, students and industrial enterprises
   operating in Slovak Republic and abroad, mainly operating in the
   manufacturing industry. In the final part, the findings are clarified -
   firstly, the key results are summarized and secondly the limitation of
   the work are discussed; areas for future development are suggested.
   The following paper is one of the outcomes of the research work for the
   project int. Nb. 6111 entitled ``Increasing Technical Knowledge Base and
   Practical Skills of Teachers and Students of the Institute of Industrial
   Engineering and Management within the ``Digital Factory{''} concept,

   (idosos), ``public policies{''} (politicas publicas), ``elderly
   person{''} (pessoa idosa), ``aging{''} (envelhecimento) and ``civic
   participation{''} (participacao cidada). The search resulted in the
   selection of 15 articles and six legal documents targeted at the elderly
   in Brazil that were submitted to content analysis by categorization. The
   results revealed that aging in Brazil has occurred in the midst of
   adaptations entrenched in cultural biases, social, economic and

Abstract = {{The use of 3D imaging techniques has been early adopted in the footwear
   industry. In particular, 3D imaging could be used to aid commerce and
   improve the quality and sales of shoes. Footwear customization is an
   added value aimed not only to improve product quality, but also consumer
   comfort. Moreover, customisation implies a new business model that
   avoids the competition of mass production coming from new manufacturers
   settled mainly in Asian countries.
   However, footwear customisation implies a significant effort at
   different levels. In manufacturing, rapid and virtual prototyping is
   required; indeed the prototype is intended to become the final product.
   The whole design procedure must be validated using exclusively virtual
   techniques to ensure the feasibility of this process, since physical
   prototypes should be avoided.
   With regard to commerce, it would be desirable for the consumer to
   choose any model of shoes from a large 3D database and be able to try
   them on looking at a magic mirror. This would probably reduce costs and
   increase sales, since shops would not require storing every shoe model
   and the process of trying several models on would be easier and faster
   for the consumer.
   In this paper, new advances in 3D techniques coming from experience in
   cinema, TV and games are successfully applied to footwear. Firstly, the
   characteristics of a high-quality stereoscopic vision system for
   footwear are presented. Secondly, a system for the interaction with
   virtual footwear models based on 3D gloves is detailed. Finally, an
   augmented reality system (magic mirror) is presented, which is
   implemented with low-cost computational elements that allow a
   hypothetical customer to check in real time the goodness of a given
   virtual footwear model from an aesthetical point of view. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Virtual machining systems are applying computers and different types of
   software in manufacturing and production in order to simulate and model
   errors of real environment in virtual reality systems. Many errors of
   CNC machine tools have an effect on the accuracy and repeatability of
   part manufacturing. Some of these errors can be reduced by controlling
   the machining process and environmental parameters. However geometrical
   errors which have a big portion of total error need more attention. In
   this paper a virtual machining system which simulates the dimensional
   and geometrical errors of real three-axis milling machining operations
   is described. The system can read the machining codes of parts and
   enforce 21 errors associated with linear and rotational motion axes in
   order to generate new codes to represent the actual machining operation.
   In order to validate the system free form profiles and surfaces of
   virtual and real machined parts are compared in order to present the

Abstract = {{In modern manufacturing it is crucial to be able to produce a product
   right first time, as efficiently as possible. Virtual prototyping can
   play a key part in fulfilling this requirement, allowing the simulation
   of production in advance without the need for unnecessary downtime,
   material waste or increased lead times. This makes, virtual reality (VR)
   potentially an ideal planning tool since, with each simulation, a better
   understanding of requirements can be reached and a more effective
   solution found.
   This application of haptic virtual reality is particularly relevant in
   the field of machining where both material and resource costs are high.
   Planning for the machining of a product requires an intricate knowledge
   of materials, processes and machining methods. Intuitive virtual reality
   interfaces can provide new, engineer-friendly means of generating such
   manufacturing sequences.
   Current research in haptic virtual reality focuses on specific
   individual aspects of machining such as path planning or simulation for
   training; however, in order to simulate multi-operation machining with a
   view to generating practical and usable process plans, in which there
   are several processes involved in bringing a product to fruition; an
   approach is required which allows this type of functionality.
   This paper presents such a haptic virtual process planning system that
   allows an operator to load and set up a billet for machining, set up,
   sequence and tear down any combination of milling, drilling or turning
   operations then produce a time-estimated process plan. All of the human
   expertise captured during this process is logged and parsed to generate
   the final instructions including operation times, tool lists, operation
   lists and route sheets in easy-to-read format.
   Via three planning examples, the generation of process plans is
   demonstrated; with these subsequently validated through their use by a
   shop floor machinist who utilised them to produce the parts, and a
   comparison to previously existing plans for the same parts. (C) 2013

Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{760-780}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the impact of digitally mediated communications
   technologies on the fashion sector. It argues that material and virtual
   fashion worlds are perpetually intersecting social realities that
   coexist relationally, simultaneously, and in mutual connection. The
   paper explores these shifting fashion landscapes in three particular
   ways in order to understand how fashion worlds are being transformed,
   enhanced, and reproduced in space and time. Firstly, it is argued that
   emergent digital technologies are remediating and refashioning existing
   cultural forms of signification such as fashion magazines and
   photography. Secondly, the potential disintermediatory effects that the
   Internet is having on fashion markets and consumption are explored,
   questioning to what extent digital technologies are enabling the
   devolution of fashion authority from traditional power brokers such as
   magazine editors and designers towards a more diversified assemblage of
   participants, including fashion bloggers and consumers. Thirdly, the
   transformative effects that digital technology is having on fashion
   consumption are explored. The Internet has opened up new spaces of
   fashion consumption that are unprecedented in their levels of ubiquity,
   immersion, fluidity, and interactivity. Fashion spaces are increasingly
   portable, must follow us around, travel with us through time and space.
   The network effects made possible by the Internet are enabling the
   creation of always-on, always-connected consumer communities.
   Increasingly we are adrift without the Internet, not with it. This is
   generating new ways of being in space where the absence of physical
   presence becomes second nature. Taken together, the collision between
   virtual and material fashion spaces requires a fundamental rethink about
   the role of fashion production, consumption, knowledge, and the laws of
   markets.}},

Abstract = {{Terrain classification of LIDAR point clouds is a fundamental problem in
   the production of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). The Simple
   Morphological Filter (SMRF) addresses this problem by applying image
   processing techniques to the data. This implementation uses a linearly
   increasing window and simple slope thresholding, along with a novel
   application of image inpainting techniques. When tested against the
   ISPRS LIDAR reference dataset, SMRF achieved a mean 85.4\% Kappa score
   when using a single parameter set and 90.02\% when optimized. SMRF is
   intended to serve as a stable base from which more advanced progressive
   filters can be designed. This approach is particularly effective at
   minimizing Type I error rates, while maintaining acceptable Type II
   error rates. As a result, the final surface preserves subtle surface
   variation in the form of tracks and trails that make this approach
   ideally suited for the production of DEMs used as ground surfaces in

Abstract = {{Mast seeding is the synchronous production of large amounts of seeds at
   long intervals in plant populations. It is observed in several genera
   and its explanation remains controversial. To test one of the most
   popular hypotheses, predator satiation, we developed a virtual
   experiment based on an individual-based model reproducing the
   interaction between trees and seed predators in a simulated forest. This
   allowed a direct comparison between masting and no-masting cases, as
   would have been impossible in reality. The large differences observed
   between the two scenarios strongly supported the hypothesis. At the same
   time, a second mechanism similar to the classic paradox of enrichment
   seemed to play a crucial role, working in synergy with predator
   satiation to keep in check seed predator populations. More generally, we
   showed that the resource distribution over time can deeply affect
   population dynamics, even when the overall amount of the resource is
   kept constant. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Recently, virtual reality (VR) technique is widely applied during

   reducing the production of physical prototypes that are very expensive
   and requires long production time. Virtual humans are used in the
   automotive industry especially for ergonomic analysis of a virtual

   interiors and driver's seat position using the digital mock-up instead
   of building the physical prototype, having a virtual validation of the
   project, in its early development phases. A successful ergonomics

Abstract = {{Industrial companies have to face fast changing markets and increasing
   customer demands regarding individual configuration of products. Within
   this turbulent environment initially defined planning circumstances and
   assumptions are no longer reliable over the whole factory lifecycle. As
   one approach to react on such uncertainties, flexible production
   planning is considered. Factories should be able to adapt according to
   changing demands and suit to even unforeseen constraints. To allow such
   flexibility, the factory planning process must be executed with special
   attention on the early phases. While setting up the key objectives and
   establishing the project basis, a focus on flexibility has to be
   mandatory. The constraints on which planning bear on need to be defined,
   but also their adaptation over the factory life-cycle must be
   considered.
   To overcome this dilemma of required level of detail but concurrent
   uncertain future estimations, scenario technique is proposed as a method
   in strategic company management. This paper deals with the extension of
   the scenario technique to be applicable during factory planning as one
   operative method in the early phases of `preparation' and `structure
   planning'. By using immersive Virtual Reality (SIR) tools, a
   visualization component will be added. This will make future scenarios
   more graspable for multi-domain planning teams and serve as a mean of

   We provide exemplar applications of the presented technique: virtual
   camera/simulcam and live storyboarding or shot prototyping. The
   matchmoving technique based on marker fields of shades of green is very
   computationally efficient - our measurements show that the matchmoving
   preview and living storyboard editing and recording can be easily done
   on today's ultramobile devices. Our technique is thus available to
   anyone at low cost and with easy setup, opening space for new levels of

Abstract = {{Process industry is known for its complexity and sensitivity with
   critical procedures saturated with demanding human-machine interfaces
   that may induce human errors thus resulting in abnormal situations.
   Abnormal situations may lead to near misses and even to severe
   accidents, which can result in loss of production and even in casualties
   and fatalities. This paper aims at abridging the gap between the highly
   demanding human machine interfaces and the training methods employed in
   the process industry by experimentally analyzing the effectiveness of
   distinct training methods in a virtually simulated abnormal situation.
   The performance of operators is measured by means of suitable Key
   Performance Indicators (KPIs) applied to the specific case study. In
   particular, we analyze experimentally two distinct training methods
   based respectively on a Power Point presentation and a 3D virtual
   environment. The positive outcomes of this approach consist in
   increasing the reliability, cost effectiveness, environmental
   friendliness, and safety of the process. This work is the result of the
   interaction between chemical engineers and experimental psychologists,

Pages = {{420-430}},
Abstract = {{This paper aims to define a standard procedure for validating a
   fixed-base driving simulator to be used for road safety studies and in
   the automotive field for development of new vehicle-subsystems. The
   driving simulator was developed at the University of Pisa (Italy) -
   Department of Mechanical, Nuclear and Production Engineering; it is
   characterized by a static cockpit and a single front projection channel,
   with vehicle and pedestrian traffic opportunely generated. The
   validation procedure consisted in a statistical comparison between data
   recorded by an instrumented vehicle on an urban path and those recorded
   by the driving simulator on the same path reproduced in virtual reality.
   A sample of 93 volunteers were submitted to both the drive tests during
   which several vehicle signals, such as speed data, acceleration, braking
   action, engine RPM and steering angle were continuously stored. Speed
   and acceleration data were subsequently analysed through conventional
   statistical methods (z-test); in order to evaluate differences between
   real and simulated driving, the statistical analysis was integrated by
   regression techniques. The analysis allowed to highlight the efficiency
   of the procedure in both the relative and absolute validation process as
   well as to evaluate potentials of the specific driving simulator. The
   procedure has general validity and can be used as a standard procedure
   for validation of fixed-base driving simulators.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last couple of years several factors have changed the behavior
   of companies to interact and collaborate. This can be attributed mainly
   to a turbulent environment. In addition, the use of Virtual Reality (VR)
   as a tool for collaboration to exchange information and data has
   increased significantly over time in production-related areas. The
   purpose of this paper is to identify the recent state of application
   areas and stages for the expedient use of VR as a collaboration tool for
   factory planning. Therefore, a literature review is given on how to
   handle factors that influence companies in general, but also regarding
   the factory planning processes. Based on this, the scenario technique in
   the area of factory planning is presented. These scenarios can be used
   as a basis for long-term planning of strategic actions. This technique
   can be especially helpful in an unpredictable future to support
   long-term decisions. Furthermore, an overview is provided in regard to
   the phases of factory planning that are supported by VR applications. In
   contrast, phases are highlighted where a VR support is needed. The basis
   for a concept is given that strives towards a continuous VR supported
   factory planning process. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{An axis-symmetrical optical laser triangulation system was developed by
   the authors to measure the inner geometry of long pipes used in the oil
   industry. It has a special optical configuration able to acquire shape
   information of the inner geometry of a section of a pipe from a single
   image frame. A collimated laser beam is pointed to the tip of a 45
   degrees conical mirror. The laser light is reflected in such a way that
   a radial light sheet is formed and intercepts the inner geometry and
   forms a bright laser line on a section of the inspected pipe. A camera
   acquires the image of the laser line through a wide angle lens. An
   odometer-based triggering system is used to shot the camera to acquire a
   set of equally spaced images at high speed while the device is moved
   along the pipe's axis. Image processing is done in real-time (between
   images acquisitions) thanks to the use of parallel computing technology.
   The measured geometry is analyzed to identify corrosion damages. The
   measured geometry and results are graphically presented using virtual
   reality techniques and devices as 3D glasses and head-mounted displays.
   The paper describes the measurement principles, calibration strategies,
   laboratory evaluation of the developed device, as well as, a practical
   example of a corroded pipe used in an industrial gas production plant.}},

Abstract = {{As media technologies become increasingly affordable, compact and
   inherently networked, new generations of telecollaborative platforms
   continue to arise which integrate these new affordances. Virtual reality
   has been primarily concerned with creating simulations of environments
   that can transport participants to real or imagined spaces that replace
   the ``real world{''}. Meanwhile Augmented Reality systems have evolved
   to interleave objects from Virtual Reality environments into the
   physical landscape. Perhaps now there is a new class of systems that
   reverse this precept to enhance dynamic media landscapes and immersive
   physical display environments to enable intuitive data exploration
   through collaboration.
   Vroom (Virtual Room) is a next-generation reconfigurable tiled display
   environment in development at the California Institute for
   Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) at the University
   of California, San Diego. Vroom enables freely scalable digital
   collaboratories, connecting distributed, high-resolution visualization
   resources for collaborative work in the sciences, engineering and the
   arts. Vroom transforms a physical space into an immersive media
   environment with large format interactive display surfaces, video
   teleconferencing and spatialized audio built on a high-speed optical
   network backbone.
   Vroom enables group collaboration for local and remote participants to
   share knowledge and experiences. Possible applications include: remote
   learning, command and control, storyboarding, post-production editorial
   review, high resolution video playback, 3D visualization, screencasting
   and image, video and multimedia file sharing. To support these various
   scenarios, Vroom features support for multiple user interfaces (optical
   tracking, touch UI, gesture interface, etc.), support for directional
   and spatialized audio, giga-pixel image interactivity, 4K video
   streaming, 3D visualization and telematic production. This paper
   explains the design process that has been utilized to make Vroom an
   accessible and intuitive immersive environment for remote collaboration
   specifically for digital cinema production.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing proliferation and psychological and physical embeddedness
   of the global digital infrastructure call us to reconsider traditional
   models of vulnerability, attack trees, and security auditing. The easy
   coordination of disparate digital means of attack suggests we should
   move to tighter coordination between digital information assurance,
   psychological operations, and physical security. Examples at the
   physical end of the spectrum includes embedded Floating Point Gate Array
   (FPGA) computer chips that can be configured on the fly to function as
   completely different chips, 3D printers that can be used to bypass
   traditional physical security, hypervisors that virtualize complexity
   previously instantiated in hardware, and immersive communications
   environments where traditional physical facilities are being replaced.
   Digital technology also has a profound ability to monitor and induce
   behavior, opinion, and identity in ways that were not possible in
   previous eras. These include vivid multimedia production resources
   capable of inducing assumptions of events and facts in large
   populations, artificial intelligent systems capable of filtering of
   large volumes of communications for population behavior and also filter
   for patterns or persons of interest, and opportunities for highly
   engaging insertions of pseudonym contact and identity imprinting with
   low risk to operatives. Analyzing the behavior of a population and
   inducing behavior seem separate at first, but from the perspective of
   bit-induced reality and bit monitored reality, the two are ever closer.
   The author proposes that we re-assess vulnerability models to ensure
   that the natural integration occurring across a new Psy-BIR-Phys
   spectrum that tracks the level at which systems are a Bit-induced
   Reality (BIR) across a psychological-physical spectrum. The examples
   presented are particularly in reference to persistent threats and
   long-term security requirements. Traditional resources and functions are
   drawn by the author in a way that reflects changing vulnerabilities as
   they migrate within the author's Psy-BIR-Phys Matrix model. Scenarios
   presented in this work, like an attack on a device with a speaker, are
   formulated by the author based on an analysis of recent incidents and
   technology trends that include mobile devices, cloud infrastructure,
   programmable logic controllers, internet-based surveillance, and social

   have a common sense that pearls have a own beauty. Therefore, the
   expected merits of the simulation are not negligible. The author of this
   paper have reported a method of modeling and visualizing perfect sphere
   pearls. For a construction of the simulation system for a preproduction,
   it is necessary to apply the visualizing method to free-form surface,
   and consider the changes of blurring and interference color due to view
   angle which was not mentioned in the earlier research. As the results,

   (2013) Histopathology 62, 351-358 Virtual reality microscope versus
   conventional microscope regarding time to diagnosis: an experimental
   study Aims: To create and evaluate a virtual reality (VR) microscope
   that is as efficient as the conventional microscope, seeking to support
   the introduction of digital slides into routine practice. Methods and
   results: A VR microscope was designed and implemented by combining
   ultra-high-resolution displays with VR technology, techniques for fast
   interaction, and high usability. It was evaluated using a mixed
   factorial experimental design with technology and task as
   within-participant variables and grade of histopathologist as a
   between-participant variable. Time to diagnosis was similar for the
   conventional and VR microscopes. However, there was a significant
   difference in the mean magnification used between the two technologies,
   with participants working at a higher level of magnification on the VR
   microscope. Conclusions: The results suggest that, with the right
   technology, efficient use of digital pathology for routine practice is a
   realistic possibility. Further work is required to explore what
   magnification is required on the VR microscope for histopathologists to
   identify diagnostic features, and the effect on this of the digital
   slide production process.}},

Abstract = {{Labor market insertion for graduates in Economics and Business
   Administration has become one of the greatest threats in the current
   economic recession. One solution to this threat is to start a business
   on their own, that is, the so-called Entrepreneurial Economy. This paper
   presents the experiences of the University of Alcala Business Department
   teachers, with undergraduate students of Economics and Business
   Administration in teaching activities developed in previous courses in
   order to encourage entrepreneurship and to equip students with the tools
   and information sources necessary for the implementation of new business
   projects. Specifically, the sample size amounts to 100 students studying
   their first year of degree.
   All developed activities are intended to facilitate the learning of
   business creation process characteristics and disseminate experiences,
   resources, virtual simulators and web links that facilitate
   entrepreneurial dynamics. That is, tasks affect those resources and
   procedures to better disclose the benefits of undertaking a business
   initiative. These experiences, from the educational point of view, are
   an interdisciplinary and complementary integration; given the range of
   dimensions that entrepreneurship concept embraces ( accounting, finance,
   human resources, environment analysis, business strategy, etc.).
   Furthermore, entrepreneurship simulators treatment, enterprise databases
   and web tools will impact both professional development and motivation
   in grade students. The ultimate goal of all activities is to implement
   strategies to stimulate effort, promoting the ability to learn on their
   own and with others, and develop thinking and decision skills to
   facilitate student autonomy, trust and personal initiatives.
   Specifically, students over a semester must prepare a business plan that
   loops through all the steps required for business creation and all basic
   business functions, from production to promotion of goods or services.
   They must present orally the business plan relying on all the necessary
   resources, such as web pages creation, digital media commercials
   recording or the business dramatization. Thus, students speaking and
   communication skills are improved. Regarding students assessment, a
   co-evaluation process has been developed, where the students assess
   their own work, the work as a whole and specifically played by each
   workgroups member. This will involve students get a 360 degrees
   assessment culture. Finally, some of the most innovative projects
   presented by the students and the experiences of students who have
   decided to move the business plan from paper to reality are related.}},

Abstract = {{The use of computer modeling and simulation tools in design programs has
   become ubiquitous over the past two decades yet with such incredible
   advances, students remain detached from the real world of bringing their
   designs to reality. Though photorealistic imagery, high fidelity
   simulation, and hyper levels of detail are possible within the virtual
   work environment, the translation to real world conditions remains a
   significant barrier for students with even the greatest of digital media
   skill. This is most notable within the context of architectural design.
   To this day there are very few accessible tools that empower designers
   to posit their ideas into reality and ensure an iterative design process
   may emerge.
   This paper outlines the development and adoption of a prototype tool,
   tentatively dubbed Arch-Viz, that bridges this gap between the virtual
   and the real world contexts. Beta-tested within a second year
   architectural design studio in Canada's largest city, Toronto, the
   Arch-Viz project has allowed students to seamlessly transition from
   initial design of buildings in primitive, physical models to digital CAD
   models, and finally at full scale in the real world using an augmented
   reality system. By overlaying digital model information atop real world
   conditions using contrast codes and geo-location, the Arch-Viz project
   promises to be a design and production paradigm that designers, not
   exclusively architects, may adopt in the future.}},

   Universities twentieth century saw at the e-learning system, an

   Since the beginning of virtual universities in the late twentieth

Abstract = {{Unlike traditional cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries,
   and performing arts centers, current cultural discourse often exists and
   is developed in impromptu, unconventional, and temporal environments
   ranging from the virtual realm of online worlds to the charged dynamics
   of streets in the urban environment. Two extremes are at play. While
   established cultural facilities oversee curatorial discretion in
   permitting visitors to engage material often for a fee within a
   preordained timeframe (i.e. a theatrical production or exhibition
   opening), online platforms allow visitors to pore through the incredible
   amounts of information free of charge and other conventional
   constraints. Despite these polarities, the cultural activity emergent
   from street life and the cultural dynamics arising from urban
   environments has also remained a strong force in a society's cultural
   development, from street performers to Speakers' Corners. This has also
   been the trend in contemporary art. The rarified and hallowed world of
   art galleries and exhibition halls must now compete with a range of
   enthusiastic, ephemeral, and ever-changing work in settings such as
   street festivals to more formalized programs such as Nuit Blanche.
   Though such organizations are exceptionally potent in showcasing to not
   only the general public, but emerging artists and students, there has
   been little in the way of ensuring such short-lived events may be
   properly documented to serve as educational resources for future
   generations.
   This paper outlines the design, development, and prototyping of
   contemporary mobile computing, via an augmented reality app entitled
   {[}AoR]t Works, in not only reinforcing the documentation of these
   contemporary art works, but also in providing a robust and innovative
   way to understand the projects in the built environment. From guided
   tours and the layering of multiple temporary works upon a shared
   specific site in the urban environment, to interviews with installation
   artists and developmental materials, the framework of the {[}AR]t Works
   project serves as an excellent tool in not only preserving the creative
   works in the urban condition, but also in continuing the development of
   emergent artists and designers in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Lean is a key process that understands customer value and its goal is to
   provide perfect value to the customer by engaging a process cycle that
   minimizes waste. This paper focuses on the implementation of Lean in the
   Design and Manufacturing Industries. The complex interactions of the
   financial, logistical, and geological processes that are involved in
   developing a product and then handing it over to customers are driving
   forces in today's industries. Hence, if industries do not implement
   Lean, product cost will rise.
   Lean design involves identifying wastage in the processes of product
   manufacturing/production. This means, specifically, eliminating waste
   and non-value-added activities in design, production, marketing, supply
   chain integration and customer interactions by making product flow
   through the Value Stream without any interruption. Our goal is to
   minimize production resources by eliminating non-value-added activities,
   thus saving time in production and improving product quality.
   The basic goal behind this paper is to reduce product cost by
   eliminating unnecessary elements that increase final product cost. This
   will be demonstrated by way of manufacturing a fuel tank by removing or
   redesigning the parts now used by the current industry. The paper also
   will show how Virtual Reality plays a key role in helping students and
   engineers to learn applications and to understand simulation more
   effectively. It is a powerful learning tool for both engineers and
   students. The paper will emphasize the development of active learning
   experiences in relation to Lean Product Development. The different
   models that are developed in this paper will help students and engineers
   to gain knowledge in various streams like Engineering, Business and
   Sciences, with the aid of Virtual Reality. This paper concentrates
   mainly on undergraduate and graduate students. Solid Works, one of the
   more common and available tools in most U.S. schools, is utilized as a
   software that allows users to change product designs on their own, so as
   to get better results. After learning these tools, users will be able to
   apply their skills in various industries to reduce non-value-added
   activities. Developing Lean Manufacturing models using Virtual Reality
   will increase any user's capability, quality and efficiency in Product
   Development.}},

   commonly exist in assembly tasks become a bottleneck in the assembly

   this paper, we present a novel interactive motion planning methodology
   for virtual assembly and disassembly operations. In our method, user's
   manipulation with force feedback device in difficult scenario is
   liberated by relaxing collision constraints. The rough path is retracted
   by our random retraction method and then connected by BiRRT algorithm.
   For each user's operation, a path successfully passing through the
   narrow passage is presented, or geometrical interference information in
   failed case is provided for motion re-planning and design modification.
   Significant improvement for trajectory planning of non-convex object is
   observed in challenging 2D scenarios with narrow passages.}},

   explore ways for effectively communicating with cultural heritage to

   sole motivator. It addresses how these three issues in virtual heritage
   need to be transformed from merely representing quantitative data
   towards cultural information using the proposed effective communication

   heritage elements, users and context. The paper offers a focused

   Non-pharmacological intervention is a critical component of total pain

   newly developed multi-modal procedural preparation and distraction
   device (Ditto T) used during acute burn wound care procedures will
   reduce the pain and anxiety of a child and increase the rate of
   re-epithelialization.
   Methods/design: Children (4 to 12 years) with acute burn injuries
   presenting for their first dressing change will be randomly assigned to
   either the (1) Control group (standard distraction) or (2) Ditto T
   intervention group (receiving Ditto T, procedural preparation and Ditto
   T distraction). It is intended that a minimum of 29 participants will be
   recruited for each treatment group. Repeated measures of pain intensity,
   anxiety, stress and healing will be taken at every dressing change until
   complete wound re-epithelialization. Further data collection will aid in
   determining patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness of the Ditto T
   intervention, as well as its effect on speed of wound
   re-epithelialization.
   Discussion: Results of this study will provide data on whether the
   disease process can be altered by reducing stress, pain and anxiety in
   the context of acute burn wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Anatomical corrosion casts of human specimens are useful teaching aids.
   However, their use is limited due to ethical dilemmas associated with
   their production, their lack of perfect reproducibility, and their
   consumption of original specimens in the process of casting. In this
   study, new approaches with modern distribution of complex anatomical
   spatial information were explored to overcome these limitations through
   the digitalization of anatomical casts of human specimens through
   three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, rapid prototype production, and
   Web-based 3D atlas construction. The corrosion cast of a lung, along
   with its associated arteries, veins, trachea, and bronchial tree was
   CT-scanned, and the data was then processed by Mimics software. Data
   from the lung casts were then reconstructed into 3D models using a
   hybrid method, utilizing both image threshold and region growing. The
   fine structures of the bronchial tree, arterial, and venous network of
   the lung were clearly displayed and demonstrated their distinct
   relationships. The multiple divisions of bronchi and bronchopulmonary
   segments were identified. The 3D models were then uploaded into a rapid
   prototype 3D printer to physically duplicate the cast. The physically
   duplicated model of the lung was rescanned by CT and reconstructed to
   detect its production accuracy. Gross observation and accuracy detection
   were used to evaluate the duplication and few differences were found.
   Finally, Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) was used to edit the
   3D casting models to construct a Web-based 3D atlas accessible through
   Internet Explorer with 3D display and annotation functions. Anat Sci

Abstract = {{The first artificial reverberation algorithms were proposed in the early
   1960s, and new, improved algorithms are published regularly. These
   algorithms have been widely used in music production since the 1970s,
   and now find applications in new fields, such as game audio. This
   overview article provides a unified review of the various approaches to
   digital artificial reverberation. The three main categories have been
   delay networks, convolution-based algorithms, and physical room models.
   Delay-network and convolution techniques have been competing in
   popularity in the music technology field, and are often employed to
   produce a desired perceptual or artistic effect. In applications
   including virtual reality, predictive acoustic modeling, and
   computer-aided design of acoustic spaces, accuracy is desired, and
   physical models have been mainly used, although, due to their
   computational complexity, they are currently mainly used for simplified
   geometries or to generate reverberation impulse responses for use with a
   convolution method. With the increase of computing power, all these
   approaches will be available in real time. A recent trend in audio
   technology is the emulation of analog artificial reverberation units,
   such as spring reverberators, using signal processing algorithms. As a
   case study we present an improved parametric model for a spring

Abstract = {{The peak and decline of world oil production is an emerging issue for
   transportation and urban planners. Peak oil from an energy perspective
   means that there will be progressively less fuel. Our work treats
   changes in oil supply as a risk to transport activity systems. A virtual
   reality survey method, based on the sim game concept, has been developed
   to audit the participant's normal weekly travel activity, and to explore
   participant's travel adaptive capacity. The travel adaptive capacity
   assessment (TACA) Sim survey uses avatars, Google MapTM, 2D scenes,
   interactive screens and feedback scores. Travel adaptive capacity is
   proposed as a measure of long-range resilience of activity systems to
   fuel supply decline. Mode adaptive potential is proposed as an indicator
   of the future demand growth for less energy intensive travel. Both
   adaptation indicators can be used for peak oil vulnerability assessment.
   A case study was conducted involving 90 participants in Christchurch New
   Zealand. All of the participants were students, general staff or
   academics at the University of Canterbury. The adaptive capacity was
   assessed by both simulated extreme fuel price shock and by asking, ``do
   you have an alternative mode?{''} without price pressure. The travel
   adaptive capacity in number of kilometers was 75\% under a 5-fold fuel
   price increase. The mode adaptive potential was 33\% cycling, 21\%
   walking and 22\% bus. Academics had adaptive capacity of only 1-5\% of
   trips by canceling or carrying out their activity from home compared to
   10-18\% for students. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Product realization, which is the goal of any product development
   process from concept to production, usually means bringing a product to
   physical reality. Problem solving and design are two of the engineering
   activities for achieving the product development process goal. For this
   reason engineering education efforts are usually focused on problem
   solving as a building block for any educational course or program
   activities. In addition, some courses and curriculum threads are usually
   dedicated to design education and practices. The common restriction of
   realization to mean physical reality, however, limits the full
   understanding and potential of better problem solving and design
   education in engineering.
   In this paper, the realization process is expanded to include the
   virtual and perceptual realities as valid domains of the product
   realization process. These domains of realization and their interactions
   with the physical reality are studied. Also, the relationships between
   research, problem solving, and design are examined in the context of
   engineering product realization. Focus, in this study, is directed to
   the understanding of research, engineering problem solving, and design
   activities as a result of the expanded realization concept. This
   understanding aims at improving engineering education by focusing on the
   key issue of creativity in program and course design, delivery, and
   assessment. To illustrate the concepts, presented in the paper, several

Abstract = {{Portland cement ( PC) production contributes by about 6\% to global
   emissions of CO2. Reduction of the PC content in the binder exerts
   therefore a direct positive effect on such emissions. Partial
   replacement of the Portland cement by pozzolanic mineral admixtures has
   been proven a possible option. The green character is even reinforced by
   making use of incinerated vegetable waste, such as rice husk ash (RHA).
   Moreover, as a result of the gap-grading effect on particle packing
   density with RHA as the fine component, high strength concrete can be
   achieved with RHA-blended cement. This has been published earlier, so
   the paper only briefly covers these aspects.
   Characteristics of the capillary pores developed in the hydrating binder
   have direct impact on the transport-based durability properties.
   However, assessment of such pore characteristics of the RHA-blended
   cement constitutes a complicated problem, especially in experimental
   approaches. This paper, therefore, presents a new economic approach to
   conduct such investigation on the realistically produced cementitious
   materials in virtual reality. The fresh packed state of the paste's
   particles is simulated by a discrete element modeling (DEM) system,
   HADES. The hydration of a (blended) cement is simulated by a so-called,
   extended integrated particle kinetics model' (XIPKM). Pore
   characteristics, such as topology, location distribution, degree of
   percolation and fraction of main channels in the pore network, are
   explored by a new modern approach named `double random multi-tree
   structuring' (DraMuTS). The size distribution of throats that
   significantly limit the transport in the pore network system is derived
   from star volume measurements. Four examples of plain PC and of
   RHA-blended PC with two w/b ratios are presented. The expected positive
   effects on transport-based durability issues due to RHA-blending are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To take up the challenge of global distributed companies, Manufacturing
   Engineering has to be accomplished in a worldwide collaborative way.
   Design and development of production processes and their execution are
   nowadays spread all over the world. To ensure quality standards and to
   create synergies between spatially distributed entities, distance
   collaboration tools must be provided to allow cooperation even over
   large distances. The Virtual Reality (VR) is thereby offering beneficial
   capabilities to exchange current planning stages, identify problems and
   solve them cooperatively. This paper introduces a new approach for
   distance collaboration, which enables users to work in a joint virtual
   space, nearly as if they were working together in the same place.
   Therefore two full-immersive CAVE-like systems are interconnected using
   the VirCA (Virtual Collaboration Arena) platform. The paper describes

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study of Half Real, a live action,
   interactive theater show employing spatial augmented reality. Half Real
   is based on a murder investigation, where the live audience votes on how

   virtual world projected onto the set. Using spatial augmented reality
   technology in theater brings new possibilities that would not be
   possible with simple video projection. Half Real models the set as a 3D
   virtual environment. Actors are tracked as they move about on stage,
   with the projected content responding to their movements. A real time AR
   system allows content to be generated procedurally. Half Real makes use
   of this by projecting vote options and results directly into the virtual
   environment. This paper describes Half Real, with a focus on the
   technology used to make the production possible. We describe the
   benefits of the techniques used and the challenges faced during

   lowering of the work in process (WIP) for the purposes of minimizing

   this, the Virtual Time Based Flow Principle (VTBFP) - a partly

Abstract = {{High fidelity signage prototyping for public buildings is impractical to
   teach in Wayshowing classes with many students. To achieve high
   fidelity, the creation of signs that look like the final production
   signs is required (but which may differ in other respects, such as using
   other materials). However, a problem is that physical signs are
   impractical to deploy in buildings that are in use. Student work with
   prototype signage may disturb other activities that go on in the space.
   Access to unused buildings can also be problematic to achieve. It is
   furthermore impractical because any existing signage tends to interfere
   with student signage. In addition, it can be very time consuming to swap
   signage systems between student groups. The use of virtual reality can
   solve those problems for signage prototyping.
   In this paper we present a course design utilizing virtual reality for
   Wayshowing. Virtual reality is often used for Wayshowing experiments and
   is then seen as a realistic substitute for reality. We see many of the
   same challenges as are presented in research as relevant for students to
   master. This includes for instance tests of sign legibility, comparing
   sign designs (through usage trials), and evacuation during stressful
   situations. It is beneficial to be able to conduct design activities
   addressing those challenges before investing in physical signs. Using 3D
   blueprints, Wayshowing design can even be carried out before actually
   constructing a building. Therefore, we believe that virtual Wayshowing
   will become an increasingly relevant skill in the future.
   Placemaking design also benefits from high fidelity, since fine details
   are important. The course can thus draw on a broad student background in
   subjects such as 3D modelling, typography, and information graphics
   design. The amount of study time and course topics is thus highly
   dependent on student academic background.}},

   research, in order to construct a methodology of VR content production
   with higher realism, an analysis method for behaviors in the human body
   induced by visual stimulation is studied. It is known that the sensation
   induced by visual stimulation affects the human behavior with a specific
   frequency component. If this kind of behavior can be modeled by using
   simple model parameters, it has the possibility to control the human
   behavior using visual stimulation or to increase its realism. In
   previous research, a parameterized first-order human behavior model has
   been proposed. The validity of the proposed model and its parameters has
   been confirmed through the analysis of verification experimental
   results. In this research, long-term experiments have been conducted to

   Virtual Reality Technology produces or creates the environment or
   reality that can be perceived by human beings by using sensory tissue
   simulation equipment or the dynamic model of unreal environment. Thus
   people can directly act intuition on the virtual environment of the 3D
   simulation model generated by computers. Based on the Virtual Reality
   Technology, the Virtual Assemble Technology is to integrate design and
   manufacture progresses under a united model. This technology has
   realized to integrate all relative processes of manufacturing and all
   relative skills into a three-dimensional dynamic simulating physical
   digital model. By such integration, the effect of product design, the
   forecast, detection, evaluation of product performance and the product
   manufacturability influenced by future manufacture, assemble or various
   activities during the product life cycle can all be simulated timely and
   parallel with the help of modeling and simulating technology by the end
   of the designation. Consequently, it brings a more effective economical
   and flexible production, a more strengthen decision-making and
   controlling level, and a much lower rate of manufacturing back change
   caused by former design. And finally it will help us to realize the
   minimization of the development cycle and cost, the optimization of the
   design quality and the maximization of the production efficiency.
   This paper will explain how to complete virtual assembly, interference
   inspection and movement simulation on a manipulator structural level
   with the use of Autodesk Inventor by taking the connecting rod

Abstract = {{In this paper, we argue that empirical research on genuine linguistic
   topics, such as on the production of multimodal utterances in the
   speaker and the interpretation of the multimodal signals in the
   interlocutor, can greatly benefit from the use of virtual reality
   technologies.
   Established methodologies for research on multimodal interactions, like
   the presentation of pre-recorded 2D videos of interaction partners as
   stimuli and the recording of interaction partners using multiple 2D
   video cameras have crucial shortcomings regarding ecological validity
   and the precision of measurements that can be achieved. In addition,
   these methodologies enforce restrictions on the researcher. The stimuli,
   for example, are not very interactive and thus not as close to natural
   interactions as ultimately desired. Also, the analysis of 2D video
   recordings requires intensive manual annotations, often frame-by-frame,
   which negatively affects the feasible number of interactions which can
   be included in a study.
   The technologies bundled under the term virtual reality offer exciting
   possibilities for the linguistic researcher: gestures can be tracked
   without being restricted to fixed perspectives, annotation can be done
   on large corpora (semi-) automatically and virtual characters can be
   used to produce specific linguistic stimuli in a repetitive but
   interactive fashion. Moreover, immersive 3D visualizations can be used
   to recreate a simulation of the recorded interactions by fusing the raw
   data with theoretic models to support an iterative data-driven
   development of linguistic theories. This paper discusses the potential
   of virtual reality technologies for linguistic research and provides
   examples for the application of the methodology.}},

   to deal with all these problems.
   The Digital Mine can be liken to ``a logistics supply chain{''}, the
   basic characteristic is the high-speed network, with broadband and
   two-way communication system, used as ``path map{''}, which shall make
   sure the fast delivery of all the data within all the relevant
   enterprises in the country; It consists of vehicles, which refers to the
   techniques of Mine CAD, virtual reality, mine simulation, scientific
   calculation, artificial intelligence, visualization and office
   automation; goods, which refers to mine data and mind application model;
   package, which refers to 3DGM(3-Dimensional Geographical Model) and data
   mining; security system, which refers to the collection and renewal

   if necessary, such as mining working-face, excavating working-face,
   underground chamber, mechanical and electronic equipments, ventilation
   and safety device, underground pipeline and communication and others,
   forming a spatial database. Thus, the entire mine's information system
   of management and service and decision support system is established.
   The Digital Mine is a huge systematic project, involving 3S (GIS, GPS,
   RS), IT (Information technology), mine science, virtual reality
   technology and visualization technology. Based on computers and network
   communication, the Digital Mine realizes the digitization of storing,
   transporting, expressing and applying of all the relevant spatial data
   and attribute data, including mine construction, exploration,

Abstract = {{A risk assessment is typically required by legal regulations in
   production automation. These regulations vary from country to country.
   Risk assessment is often incomplete in industrial practice. Not all
   hazards are detected and risks are estimated insufficiently.
   Furthermore, risks are mostly assessed after the design of the product
   and/or production process. As result additional safety measures to
   reduce risks will cause higher costs and delays. This paper proposes an
   approach to semi-automatically derive risk from a virtual reality (VR)
   model of a machine. The focus is on the specific category of crushing
   hazard. These include situations where a human being might be hurt by
   being crushed. The VR model is based on a CAD model which mostly has
   been developed during the design phase of almost all technical products.
   The core idea is to identify moving parts of the machine and to
   calculate possible crushing zones by automatic distance approximations.
   The used algorithm relies on geometric CAD data. It uses axis aligned
   bounding volumes (AABB's) and the octree data structure. The concept is
   implemented in a prototype which especially determines crushing and
   shearing hazards and visualizes the result in the VR model for the
   experts. The software supports the process of risk assessment a precise
   and methodical approach and hardly minimizes the possibility of
   non-considering potential safety hazards. The prototype permits an
   effective, exact and methodical practice to the experts responsible in
   the process of the risk assessment by giving targeted advices.
   Furthermore, it allows the analysis of crushing hazards already during
   the design phase.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) is a widely used testing approach for
   embedded systems, where real components and/or controllers are tested in
   closed-loop with a simulation model. In this paper, we generalize HIL by
   combining multiple simulations and real components into a Hybrid Process
   Simulation (HPS). An HPS is a test setup that contains at least one
   simulated and one actual component, but may contain many of both. It is
   implemented such that each simulated component can be swapped out with
   its real counterpart without making changes to the existing system, and
   vice versa. In this paper, an ontology which provides a conceptual
   architecture is developed for an HPS, such that a general interpretation
   of a manufacturing system's implementation is made possible. A
   formalized application method is then devised for replacing simulations
   with real processes and vice versa. Aconceptual architecture is put
   forth that separates the effect of a component from its spatial essence
   (volume or mass). This separation allows workpieces in a manufacturing
   process, for example, to go from the physical world into the virtual
   world (computer simulation) and back again repeatedly. The conceptual
   architecture is applied to a small manufacturing line in the following
   scenarios: replacing a real robot with a simulated robot, replacing a
   manufacturing cell with a simulated manufacturing cell, and adding a new
   simulated manufacturing cell to the existing system. These applications
   successfully demonstrate how an HPS can be used to test a manufacturing
   system setup with multiple regions of real and simulated components.
   Note to Practitioner-Traditionally, in the manufacturing system
   development process, once the design is completed, a simulation model is
   built for design validation. Then, the actual system is built. The
   confidence of the simulation is limited by the accuracy of the
   simulation model, and testing of the actual system can be time-consuming
   with high safety risks, such as personal injury and damages to
   equipment. To accommodate product changes and revisions, there is an
   ongoing continuous improvement process on the plant floor, such as
   reconfiguration of manufacturing system equipment, and adding hardware
   and software into existing processes. This may result in loss of
   production due to a long validation period with possibilities of damaged
   equipment. With the HPS approach outlined in this paper, however, the
   simulated and actual components can be validated and tested iteratively;
   this means each component can be tested with more individual focus,
   without having to wait until the entire process is complete. In the case
   of modifying an existing system, simulations can be seamlessly
   integrated with the real process to evaluate different solutions before
   a particular option is financially committed. Because the actual
   components are used during the simulation phase, the overall validation
   accuracy is less dependent on a single simulation model, while the
   testing scope is significantly expanded.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the scientific and political context of the
   production, exhibition and reception of a single panorama, Robert
   Burford's Summer and Winter Views of the Polar Regions (1850). This
   panorama represented the first Admiralty-sponsored search for John
   Franklin's missing expedition, which had departed in 1845 and expected
   to cross the Northwest Passage. Burford clearly collaborated with the
   Admiralty, acquiring permission to base the panorama on sketches taken
   by Lieutenant William Browne, an officer on the expedition. Burford
   repaid the Admiralty by supporting their current endeavours in the
   Arctic through both panorama and programme. However, the many reviews of
   this popular panorama reveal that viewers did not necessarily agree with
   Burford and that multiple interpretations of this panorama were extant.
   Detailed examination of the context of this single exhibition suggests
   that a reassessment of the influence the proprietors of such exhibitions
   held over their viewers is necessary. It also suggests that
   collaborations between proprietors of visual entertainments and
   organizations such as the Admiralty were probably deeper and more
   widespread than previously acknowledged.}},

Title = {{Construction industry offsite production: A virtual reality interactive
   training environment prototype}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The `traditional' construction industry has constantly been challenged
   to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite production (OSP),
   under the umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC), has been
   acknowledged as a means to help improve construction industry
   performance as well as meet new market demands through the provision of
   improved, adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment
   of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end
   result and be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
   construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the specifics,
   merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP systems in order to
   achieve the desired outcomes and consequently improve industry
   performance.
   On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate `experiential'
   learning, which is argued to be particularly effective where a great
   deal of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has
   been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of
   the actual training context. In order to address the problems
   encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been
   proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype, in order
   to provide a risk-free environment for learning without the `do-or-die'
   consequences often faced on real construction projects. The proffered
   solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new working
   conditions associated with OSP practices. While the `scenes' of the VR
   environment take place on a construction site, the environment
   predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers,
   construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and
   manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence
   overcome `knowledge silos' or `knowledge compartmentation'. The VR
   environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by professionals'
   decisions, faulty work, and health and safety issues to occur: where the
   implications of which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and
   resources. The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
   associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow `things to go wrong'
   and consequently allows users not only to `experience' the resulting
   implications but also to reflect on those implications as part of the
   learning process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for
   the first development phase of the VR interactive training environment.
   While the prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
   industry, the research community, and academia from different EU
   countries, the data used in developing the prototype was constrained to
   one project in the UK which may limit the generalisability of results.

Abstract = {{Looking for more active and motivating methodological alternatives from
   the students' perspective, which promote analysis and investigation
   abilities that make the student a more participative agent and some
   learning processes are facilitated, a practical study was conducted in
   the University of La Sabana (Chia, Colombia), in Computing Engineering
   (INF) and Agroindustrial Production Engineering (IPA) academic programs
   under the guiding question: Is Second Life an attractive tool for
   students, does it increment motivation, promote participation and
   facilitate learning processes in electronic related subjects in
   Engineering degrees?
   Second Life (SL) platform was then used as a traditional on-site class
   complement in electronic related subjects. A follow up was conducted
   with several groups during a year and a half, some students followed the
   subject with the traditional on-site methodology and others did it
   following a mixed methodology that combined traditional on-site lessons
   with virtual sessions trough SL, making a comparison and applying a
   quantitative as well as a qualitative methodology for the information
   analysis and recollection.
   After the specified study period it was found that using SL as part of
   the methodology, increments motivation toward electronic related
   subjects, and promotes participation and investigation, due to the fact
   that this tool makes learning possible in a funnier, more interactive
   and deeper way than if it had been taught in a master class. Having
   real-time access from a virtual classroom to all types of audiovisual
   information, helps more senses get involved in the learning process,
   making it more effective; nevertheless a weakness was detected related
   to the attention and concentration: students tend to get distracted,
   because their classroom is the computer and from there they have access
   not only to the many worlds of SL but to all the social networks and the
   Internet in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mining production in underground spaces will be in the future realized
   by intelligent robotic systems without human presence. The control of
   these processes will be based on application of autonomous cooperative
   units that can be put together to manage the production goals. As the
   mining production is connected to natural raw materials deposits, where
   the process environment models and activities cannot be fully
   determined, the human supervision will be necessary. Classical process
   control, with the external system description of the dynamic behavior
   will be changed by the use of holonic systems that can be well suited to
   responsive manufacturing settings, where the manufacturing processes
   regularly changes. Similarly for the process visualization the classical
   methods - SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems will
   be changed by more sophisticated technology given by tools of virtual
   reality.
   Models used in process control are based on state representation of
   systems, caused by the necessity to obtain more information to
   understand and describe the dynamics of complex system in the control
   process. State space model that represents the dynamic properties of the
   system and the behavior of system in the state space is represented by
   the state trajectory (given by values of state variables in the observed
   time period). The problem occurs in many cases that the state variables
   do not have the physical dimensions and we are not able to measure them.
   The Virtual Reality tools provide the possibility for effective
   visualization of such a virtual and complex systems description in
   special artificial space.}},

   realistic augmented reality is correct illumination simulation. Mobile
   augmented reality systems is one of the best options for introducing
   augmented reality to the mass market due to its low production cost and
   ubiquitousness. In mobile augmented reality systems, the ability to
   correctly simulate in realtime the illumination direction that matches
   the illumination direction of the real world is limited. Developing a
   mobile augmented reality systems with the ability to estimate
   illumination direction presents a challenge due to low computation power

   estimation for mobile augmented reality systems, using analysis of
   shadow produced by a reference object that doubles as a 3D augmented
   reality marker. The implementation of the method could estimate the
   direction of a single strong light source in a controlled environment
   with a very good degree of accuracy, with angular error averaging lower

Abstract = {{As teachers of foreign languages, we pursue to improve our students'
   communication skills; we aim at an optimum interaction amongst them. If
   we consider interaction as the core of the communication process, due to
   the fact that there is an exchange of information, written interaction
   is a skill that should be developed at a similar level to spoken
   interaction in order to consider our pupils competent students. For this
   goal to be achieved, some of us use wikis or web 2.0.
   The use of wikis to develop students' linguistic skills, mainly reading
   and writing, has been extended in the Teaching of Foreign Languages due
   to the fact that wikis are virtual platforms and as an element belonging
   to the area of Internet it is closer to the students' reality.
   Wikispaces is placed amongst the free access platforms addressed to
   independent users and, especially, to professionals of teaching. In the
   University of Wurzburg, as a teacher of Spanish as a Foreign Language, I
   have been working on projects with level A1 students whose written and
   reading comprehension skills have been improving through to the use of
   Wikispaces within the teaching-learning process.
   The aim of this paper is to present the results of some activities
   developed through the free access platform Wikispaces, proving its
   utility and the advantages of using an independent wiki instead of a
   platform belonging to the institution the students and teacher belong
   to.}},

Abstract = {{Today design information often takes the form of building information
   models (BIM). The physical reality of construction projects, however, is
   out there on the job site. It is on the job site where the PR of
   construction projects and the information from project documentation
   meet. A process inverse to the process of modeling is occurring.
   Establishing the relationship between these two aspects of construction
   has so far been exclusively the domain of human effort not assisted much
   by information technology. Many construction errors occur when the
   information in project documentation is poorly transferred to physical
   reality either because the information is misunderstood or misused.
   There have been numerous attempts to try to minimize these errors that
   focus mainly on the production of higher and higher quality
   documentation and presentations. This however has not been able to solve
   the access problems to relevant information on field which is often
   difficult. In recent years, however progress has been made in field of
   mobile devices. Now that they are suitable for augmented reality (AR)
   technology, virtual BIM models can be integrated into live picture of
   the real environment. This may facilitate the access to relevant
   information and with that better use, visualization and interpretation
   of project documentation can be achieved. The AR technology is not new,
   but this is still relatively unexplored in the field of AEC (Wang,
   2011). In this paper we present the theoretical framework for evaluating
   the role of augmented reality in construction. We propose that its main
   role is to facilitate the mapping process that occurs between the
   ``symbol{''} and ``reality{''} nodes of the meaning triangle and then
   further elaborate on the specific locations in the construction
   processes where augmented reality can be applied.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturing facilities are expected to maintain a high level of
   production and at the same time, employ strict safety standards to
   ensure the safe evacuation of the people in the event of emergencies
   (fire is considered in this paper). These two goals are often
   conflicting. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate evacuation
   safety versus productivity concurrently for various, widely known
   manufacturing layouts. While the safety performance indicators such as
   evacuation times are inferred from the crowd (agent based) simulation,
   the productivity performance indicators (e.g. throughput) are analyzed
   using the discrete event simulation. To this end, this research focuses
   on creating innovative techniques for developing accurate crowd
   simulations, where Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent framework is
   employed to build each person's individual actions and the interactions
   between them. The data model and rule based action algorithms for each
   agent are reverse-engineered from the human-in-the-loop experiments in
   the immersive virtual reality environments. Finally, experiments are
   conducted using the constructed simulations to compare safety and
   productivity for different layouts. To demonstrate the proposed
   methodology, an automotive power-train (engine and transmission)
   manufacturing plant was used. Initial results look quite promising. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cognitive and
   physical impact of virtual reality (VR) integrated training versus
   traditional training methods in the domain of weld training.
   Background: Weld training is very important in various industries and
   represents a complex skill set appropriate for advanced training
   intervention. As such, there has been a long search for the most
   successful and most cost-effective method for training new welders.
   Method: Participants in this study were randomly assigned to one of two
   separate training courses taught by sanctioned American Welding Society
   certified welding instructors; the duration of each course was 2 weeks.
   After completing the training for a specific weld type, participants
   were given the opportunity to test for the corresponding certification.
   Participants were evaluated in terms of their cognitive and physical
   parameters, total training time exposure, and welding certification
   awards earned. Each of the four weld types taught in this study
   represented distinct levels of difficulty and required the development
   of specialized knowledge and skills.
   Results: This study demonstrated that participants in the VR integrated
   training group (VR50) performed as well as, and in some cases,
   significantly outperformed, the traditional welding (TW) training group.
   The VR50 group was found to have a 41.6\% increase in overall
   certifications earned compared with the TW group.
   Conclusion: VR technology is a valuable tool for the production of
   skilled welders in a shorter time and often with more highly developed
   skills than their traditionally trained counterparts.
   Application: These findings strongly support the use of VR integrated
   training in the welding industry.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial hearing enables translation of an auditory scene into a
   perceived 3-D image by interpreting the acoustic cues related to the

Abstract = {{In the last years an enormous progress has been made in improving the
   visual quality of virtual worlds through approximations of former
   computationally expensive global illumination (GI) effects.
   Nevertheless, the handling of dynamic or even deformable content in
   massive data sets illuminated and shadowed by massive light sources
   still represents some kind of killer application. Besides the gaming
   industry, these demands are especially made in digital factory planning
   applications, where moreover preprocessing times and additional manual
   preparations of the virtual scenarios have to be avoided to keep a short
   time to production and accordingly to market. Therefore, we present an
   efficient rendering pipeline and concept for the creation of a plausible
   illumination for the digital factory, able to handle dynamic content in
   massive data sets at a large extent, that are plausibly illuminated and
   shadowed with a lot of light sources and encoded with high dynamic range
   information at interactive frame rates in a high resolution. The most
   important aspects for a visually plausible result are analysed on basis
   of real images of a factory and at last evaluated with the achieved
   results. Finally, we give a detailed overview and analysis of the
   performance of the incorporated techniques on modern graphics hardware
   to identify the main bottlenecks and key points for future research and
   conclude with an extensive reflection of the benefits of a plausible
   illumination for digital factory planning applications.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter looks at the technology involved in the mixing of 3D
   graphics with broadcast video in real time. This is essentially the
   application of augmented reality techniques in the context of TV
   production. Examples of the use of ibis technology include virtual
   graphics used for presenting election results, and graphics overlaid on
   a sports pitch to indicate distances. Whilst similar techniques are
   commonly used in films, these often require extensive post-production;
   this chapter focuses specifically on approaches that can be used live,
   which is a common requirement for TV, particularly in news and sport.
   Following a brief review of the history of virtual graphics in TV, the
   technology used in each stage of the production process is examined,
   starting with the camera and lens. Some of the important characteristics
   of broadcast video are discussed, and the need for lens calibration is
   explained. To maintain accurate alignment of the virtual graphics and
   the real scene, the motion of the camera must be tracked accurately, and
   methods for achieving this are reviewed. The requirements for
   high-quality rendering of graphics are then discussed, looking
   particularly at the differences from rendering for applications such as
   computer games. The process of keying graphics into an image using
   chroma-key is then examined in detail. It can be difficult for actors or
   presenters to work with virtual objects in a studio, unless there is
   some way for them to see what is going on, so methods of providing
   visual feedback are presented. Some specific issues related to the use
   of virtual graphics for sports are then discussed, including methods for
   tracking camera motion and keying graphics onto areas such as grass or
   sand. The chap:er concludes with a short discussion of an alternative
   approach to combining graphics and live action, in which graphical
   representations of real objects and people are created from live video,
   and placed into a 3D model, allowing the scene to be rendered from a
   viewpoint that is not tied to the location of the camera.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, with rapid advancement of technology, people can roam around
   the virtual world through the aid of the Internet. One of these advances
   is a photographic technique called panoramic view where images are

   view is high. One of the popular software for generating panoramic views
   is Apple Inc.'s QuickTime VR (QTVR). Nevertheless. iPhone Operating
   System (iOS) does not support the existing QTVR software. Therefore, in
   this paper, a low-cost method for generating panoramic views on mobile
   platform is proposed by storing finite images in an array in order to
   generate a 360o panoramic view. This method can be supported by all
   kinds of platform and therefore can be installed in any mobile devices
   without having to use any intermediate software to convert the format of
   the images. The outcome is a cylindrical panoramic view that allows the
   user to gain a 360o clear vision around historical monuments in a mobile
   virtual heritage exploration using lower computational cost but with

Abstract = {{This paper presents an industrial application called ``RVPI{''} {[}1]
   for training operators in a tyre manufacturing plant. This training is
   performed through an Informed Virtual Environment integrating different
   aspects of human activity and expertise. To create the system, knowledge
   extraction and a co-design of the system have been realized in
   collaboration with the German tyre manufacturer Continental. The system
   is deployed in real plants in five different countries and is now
   becoming a regular training tool. Results show that production costs are
   reduced with RVPI due to a shorter training period and a better
   understanding of the process.}},

Abstract = {{The leather tanning process carries a high cultural value in Guimaraes
   city. In some areas of Portugal, most of the society and its history are
   somehow interlaced with the history of the leather and all the
   associated processes of its production. There is a great lack of a
   ``vivid{''} memory about the leather tanning process and its social
   implications. References to it in Guimaraes city can be reduced to text
   and poor quality pictures. On the other hand, it is important to
   transmit to future generations the valuable role of the leather tanning
   in the local culture. At this point, the use of augmented reality
   techniques can help to illustrate interactively, expressively and with a
   compelling degree of immersion how this process used to be done, and
   help to preserve its memory. This project consisted in the development
   and implementation of an augmented reality application to young
   audiences that illustrates the ancient leather tanning process
   step-by-step. The resulting visualizations offer an impressive education
   experience that help to transfer a significant culture value of the
   Guimaraes city.}},

   DC servomotor and brake}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL ROBOT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{492-499}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to present a hybrid actuator controller to
   obtain fast and stiff position response without any overshoot by
   blending input signals of a DC servomotor and a particle brake.
   Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid actuator controller has a
   module to estimate instantaneous changes in inertia and a blending
   algorithm that adjusts input signals to the motor and the brake so that
   together, as a hybrid actuator, they can achieve a fast, stiff position
   response without overshoot. The control logic implemented in the
   controller is derived from the kinematics of the system. For the
   blending algorithm, two separate cases are explored in which the user
   has the option to either utilize the full-braking capacity or specify a
   safe deceleration limit for the system.
   Findings - The blending algorithm enables the system to operate nearly
   twice as fast as the motor-only case without any overshoot or
   oscillations. The controller can reject inertial load changes and
   significant external disturbances.
   Originality/value - Such hybrid actuators along with the developed
   controller can be used in robotics and automation to increase the system
   accuracy and operational speed resulting in higher production rates. In
   addition, much stiffer haptic force feedback interfaces for virtual
   reality applications can be designed with smaller actuators. The
   blending algorithm provides considerable improvements and uses a
   physics-based simple and easy-to-implement structure.}},

Abstract = {{Framework in e-business platform based on VRT (Virtual Reality
   Technology) was discussed, and difficulties in the process were
   investigated, which was followed by corresponding solutions. Then
   solution was got as: (1) in allusion to exceptional situation in the
   server-side, the mechanism of cutoff and junction is wondrously
   effective by the way of using the language statements, ``try{''} and
   ``catch{''}; (2) packaging data enables server-side to receive a great
   deal of data, and to escape data pileup; (3) using the way of scene
   switchover can settle harmonization of the whole and the part; (4)
   problem of motion picture flicker can be commendably solved by using
   double buffer memory of technology with Java; (5) the key numeration
   algorithm of bitmap rotation can account for the problem of quick
   rotation of bitmap.
   Now, one of the successful secrets of e-business is it to enable
   satisfying furthest a client on understanding merchandise (especially a
   new production) by the way of face to face and tasting of personal use
   on it. Salesmanship of a new kind of sedan is a ready-made example how
   can we roundly and truly exhibit outfit and feature of the sedan to the
   client by a lifelike scene? How can the consumer experience if the sedan
   jounces badly when it runs on an uneven road surface? A similar example
   is it for consumer's trying and being directly acquainted with a set of
   intelligentized household electrical appliances. And a more complicated
   illustration is performance revelation of an apparatus with high class
   and buyer's operation experience on it. Because there is a long-distance
   between merchant and buyer, both of the needs of e-business, ``face to
   face{''} acquaintance and experience of merchandise, are hardly done.
   Whereas, only a long-distance e-business VR platform is set up by both
   of VRT and instrument of long-distance computer information, it will be
   able to build a bridge between the visional and the actual and to
   achieve the demand of e-business above.}},

Abstract = {{Soil maps are an important and integral component of national geospatial
   data infrastructures. The creation of these maps involves a
   geovisualization exercise whereby soil scientists develop cognitive
   models that correlate observable landscape features to soil occurrence.
   This is traditionally an analog process, cognitively demanding, time
   consuming, and invariably non-collaborative. A new geovirtual soil
   mapping technique is proposed in this paper in the form of an innovative
   Experiential GIS (EGIS) environment. This immersive environment enables
   soil maps to be constructed through experiencing and interacting with
   spatial data through immersion in 3D geovirtual scenes. The system
   outlined integrates GIS, immersive geovisualization, and robust
   geodatabase capabilities. Four soil scientists with extensive soil
   mapping experience ranging from 5 to over 20 years are concurrently
   immersed in the same 3D geovirtual landscape which more closely mirrors
   the way in which we view the world around us. The soil scientists are
   immersed within the 3D scene where they are essentially freed from the
   laws of physics, and may roam anywhere across the landscape as if in a
   virtual helicopter. The landscape is draped with any combination of
   orthoimagery and GIS-derived data allowing soil scientists to interpret,
   digitally delineate, and attribute soil boundaries. Exploiting the EGIS
   technology while maintaining the centrality of the soil scientist in
   soil interpretation and soil map production, promises considerable
   resource efficiencies than those achieved in traditional soil survey The
   paper lays out the nature of this potential paradigm shift in soil
   mapping. The results of using this technology to construct soil
   geographic knowledge are also discussed in terms of soil map detail,
   cost efficiencies, time effectiveness, system usability,
   geocollaborative soil mapping advantages, and the reduced cognitive
   workload on practicing soil scientists.}},

Abstract = {{The increased computational power of portable devices such as smart
   phones and laptops, and their integration with widely available global
   positioning systems, are opening the way for a new range of
   location-based applications that integrate and coordinate users'
   mediated interactions and data exchanges with other users' live
   geographical positions. This user-generated information, shared on
   navigable live virtual maps such as Google Latitude, Foursquare and
   Gowalla, illustrates the increasing use of location-based applications
   and the Web to create, assemble and disseminate personal information (in
   the form of images, sounds and text) to enable shared experiences of
   individually and socially relevant spaces and events. The new virtual
   maps, in which this information is visually blurred and merged,
   represent the emergence of a new paradigm in the visualisation of space.
   The article elaborates on the fundamental social and perceptual shifts
   that are being operated today by these new technologies and software
   applications that the author refers to as geomedia. Geomedia are not new
   media per se, but platforms that merge existing electronic media + the
   Internet + location-based technologies (or locative media) + AR
   (Augmented Reality) technologies in a new mode of digital composite
   imaging, data association and socially maintained data exchange and
   communication. In the article the author examines the early adoption of
   such new geolocation-based technologies and develops a theoretical
   analysis of the ontological and epistemological shifts that characterise
   their contemporary evolution, patterns of production and exchange, and
   the unique form of geolocational digital re-aggregation of which digital
   images are now a part.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual prototyping (VP) is more commonly used alternative to rapid
   prototyping (RP) to validate products without substantial investments.
   This article covers recent advancements in VP technologies to
   accommodate kinematics and use them to evaluate functional aspects of
   automotive designs. Traditionally to validate effective function of the
   product, prototypes were constructed in the earlier stages of design.
   These prototypes were used to validate design functions of new products.
   Subsequently products were launched for production runs after
   corrections were made for issues found during prototyping stages. VP
   techniques use advancements in software tools to mimic the physical
   prototyping of product. The new advancements of using function
   parameters in soft tools added new paradigm in VP techniques. Kinematics
   with function parameters such as load conditions, motions are added
   using force (F) and motion (M) functions in design scenario. Kinematics
   used in virtual environment uses positions, velocity, acceleration,
   inertial forces, and power requirements, of all the components in
   mechanisms to recreate virtual effect on the models. Comprehensive
   engineering designs are produced reducing product design cycle by saving
   time, costs in set ups and manufacturing the physical prototypes. This
   extension of virtual design process for physical sampling is unique and
   was developed, implemented successfully in automotive design
   application. In this paper experimental study conducted on a car
   carrier, which is developed under authors responsibility has been used
   to illustrate VP techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) now a day is progressively being used in our
   manufacturing environments. In production or maintenance processes, the
   most important VR application can be assembly areas as the efficiency of
   a production or maintenance scheme primarily depends on the assembly and
   disassembly (A/D) sequence, number of gripper changes and the path used
   in an A/D process. In this paper, a novel optimum assembly algorithm
   with ant colony algorithm is proposed to solve the maintenance assembly
   process for 3D objects and complex environments, and to find both
   optimal sequence and 3D path planning. Sequentially, the assembly
   sequence was optimized by a traditional ant colony optimization
   algorithm and then, the 3D path planning with the optimized sequence
   information was optimized by combining an ant colony algorithm enhanced
   by potential field concepts. Simulation results showed that proposed
   algorithm has faster convergence rate towards the optimal solution when
   compared with existing algorithms based on genetics and traditional ant
   colony approach.}},

Abstract = {{Along with the development of container terminal towards the automatic
   direction of multi-level and multi-link, it becomes a policy demand of
   operation to insure ``health, safety and environment{''}. Aimed at the
   production organization characteristic of container terminal, this work
   applied the method of hazard identification and classification to define
   the scope of emergency response simulation; then, to represent the
   emergency plan with a structural form which will meet the requirement of
   fast emergency response decision; finally, this work proposed applying
   distributed virtual reality technology to the research of container
   terminal emergency management, and gave the distributed virtual reality
   system framework of container terminal response simulation, and
   implemented the emergency response simulation system of a certain
   container terminal, which avoids the deficiency of reality of accident
   simulation and the non-significant training effect of the participants.
   The method proposed by this paper has the reference meaning of the
   similar emergency management research in other field.}},

Abstract = {{A fixture is a special tool used to accurately and stably locate the
   workpiece during machining process. Proper fixture design improves the

   case-based reasoning (CBR) method for machining fixture design in a VR
   based integrated system. In this paper, an approach combines the RBR and
   fuzzy comprehensive judgment method is proposed for reasoning suitable
   locating schemes and locating features. Based on the reasoning results,
   a CBR method for machining fixture design is then presented. This method
   could help designers, by referencing previous design cases, to make a
   conceptual fixturing solution quickly. Finally, the implementation of
   proposed system is outlined and cases study has been used to demonstrate

Abstract = {{The Virtual Reality (VR) is an advanced technology whose usage grew
   steadily over the past years. As it is important that future engineers
   learn how to use advanced technologies during their studies, it is
   important to include VR in the engineering education, especially at
   universities. This paper presents the use of the VR technology in
   different areas of engineering education at universities. It will be
   described how VR can be used to improve lectures. In contrast to the use
   for exercises and practical training, discussed next, lectures target
   large groups of students. In addition to use VR to enrich the
   visualization of the teaching subject, VR can be a teaching object
   itself; for the students to learn how to use VR. Finally it is described
   how students can use VR for their research projects and theses.
   For the presented applications of the VR technology for educational
   purposes, the chances it holds, and the challenges that need to be
   solved, will be discussed. Those challenges are especially the creation
   of the VR content, the possibilities for interaction within the VR
   environment as well as the integration of VR in a didactic concept.
   In summary, this paper will show how the use of Virtual Reality systems
   for educational purposes at universities will improve the imparting of
   complex issues and therefore enables a faster and more purposeful expert
   education. It will outline how the visualization of the relevant
   teaching content, using the virtual-interactive environment in
   combination with practical training, will help to improve the training
   results.}},

Abstract = {{The virtual manufacturing is an advanced manufacturing technology which
   came into being in 1990s. Due to fierce market competition,
   manufacturers are making radical changes in management practices and
   investing greatly in advanced technologies in order to achieve
   sustainable competitive advantage. Under this circumstances, the virtual
   manufacturing technology was formed gradually. Nowadays, the concordant
   understanding of virtual manufacturing is: set up the virtual model of
   production system and then simulate the real manufacturing process.
   According to that, it's obvious to find that without real manufacturing
   process, the satisfaction of virtual model production system can still
   be verified. If some changes about the virtual manufacturing model need
   to be done for optimizing production system, the right of making
   corresponding changes is rested in manufacturer's hands and it's easier
   to obtain the optimization by the means of virtual manufacturing than
   the traditional ones. Virtual manufacturing has made rapid progress in
   the 21st century. This article introduced the definition and
   characteristics of virtual manufacturing and its classification and key
   technologies, its development and application situation, and finally, we
   pointed out the developing trend of virtual manufacturing and gave some
   suggestions on that.}},

Abstract = {{Increased responsiveness of modern production systems has become
   nowadays mandatory in order to meet the global market's needs. Delays
   and software issues arise when the production system must be adapted to
   a market shift, because of the heterogeneous composition (various
   automation manufacturers) of the automated production system. Planning
   tools are needed to optimize the production when the demand for the
   products volume and/or the produced products changes. An informational
   bottleneck and a major time loss are easily recognized between the
   obtained planning optimization results and their actual implementation
   into the real automated production system. Using software planning which
   encompasses an OPC interface we managed to link a model of the line with
   the real production line. This allows the control of the real
   manufacturing system through the virtual model covering one of the main
   goals of the Digital Factory concept integration of the digital models

   a realistic manner and can be visualized in virtual 3D in real-time.
   Furthermore, the scaling effects in sub-millimeter scale that generally
   causes misalignments due to dominant surface forces are uniquely taken

   for each anatomical part and this means that is not possible to use the
   skeleton for modify the body parts positions. This thing involves a
   segmentation for create a mesh deformation for each body parts. The
   movement is finally based temporary fusion of the static postures and
   involves increasing the speed of the positions. In this case every
   posture xi has allocated a time ti seconds. The dynamic human body can
   be used in simulation of the garment product. The virtual presentation
   of the garment product on a moving body is more attractive than a static

Abstract = {{Currently, quality management is carried out in a sequential feed
   forward manner. Inspections are carried out from process to process. As
   the requirements are getting diversified, the number of inspections
   increases rapidly. This approach is verification-based. But if we look
   at quality management from validation point of view, another quality
   management and inspection approach comes up. It is to look at quality
   management in the reverse direction from customers' point of view. If we
   consider quality as satisfaction of our customers, then we can reduce
   the number of inspections and focus our efforts to carry out inspections
   to really satisfy our customers, not to satisfy design requirements. To
   achieve this goal, we have to characterize our customer's quality
   requirements as patterns and use customer's profiles of quality to
   manage quality in production. This is a feed back approach and we need
   feedback information about how our customers use our machines. Although
   this approach has great benefits of really satisfying our customers and
   of substantially reducing number of inspections, its disadvantage is
   that it cannot be applied to new products. But if we utilize VR
   technology, we can estimate how our customers will use such new products
   in their own environments and can obtain our customer's profiles of
   quality requirements before they are really put to use. Such virtual
   feedback will enable application of reverse quality management to new
   products and would satisfy our customers greatly and would reduce the
   number of inspections greatly. Last but most important is that such
   feedback information will provide us with information how we should
   change our design models to really meet our customer's expectations.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Computer-based surgical simulators create a no-risk virtual
   environment where surgeons can develop and refine skills through
   harmless repetition. These applications may be of particular benefit to
   neurosurgeons, as the vulnerability of nervous tissue limits the margin
   for error. The rapid progression of computer-processing capabilities in
   recent years has led to the development of more sophisticated and
   realistic neurosurgery simulators.
   OBJECTIVE: To catalogue the most salient of these advances and
   characterize our current effort to create a spine surgery simulator.
   METHODS: An extensive search of the databases Ovid-MEDLINE, PubMed, and
   Google Scholar was conducted. Search terms included, but were not
   limited to: neurosurgery combined with simulation, virtual reality,
   haptics, and 3-dimensional imaging.
   RESULTS: A survey of the literature reveals that surgical simulators are
   evolving from platforms used for preoperative planning and anatomic
   education into programs that aim to simulate essential components of key
   neurosurgical procedures. This evolution is predicated upon the
   advancement of 3 main components of simulation: graphics/ volume
   rendering, model behavior/tissue deformation, and haptic feedback.
   CONCLUSION: The computational burden created by the integration of these
   complex components often limits the fluidity of real-time interactive
   simulators. Although haptic interfaces have become increasingly
   sophisticated, the production of realistic tactile sensory feedback
   remains a formidable and costly challenge. The rate of future progress
   may be contingent upon international collaboration between research
   groups and the establishment of common simulation platforms. Given
   current limitations, the most potential for growth lies in the
   innovative design of models that expand the procedural applications of
   neurosurgery simulation environments.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, much effort has been put into the application of information
   technology in all product manufacturing processes in order to introduce
   new products to the market more rapidly and efficiently and trim the
   cost for product development. Especially, digital production supports
   all the manufacturing activities based on a digital plant. The digital
   plant refers to the computer model that materializes the integrated
   modeling of the product, process, production equipment, and environment
   for an actual manufacturing plant. Virtual reality (VR) technologies
   also have been developing rapidly and are being implemented in the
   manufacturing field; they provide the conditions for evaluating products
   and plants in realistic virtual space. Many studies have already been
   undertaken about VR-based technologies such as computer graphics, 3D
   displays, human-computer interface, and virtual prototyping, which are
   being practically applied in the manufacturing industry. In order to
   create a prototype, earlier studies were focused on methods using
   product data but there is a technical requirement to review the plant
   that consists of products, processes, facilities, and labor.
   Furthermore, the quality of VR data depends on the worker (or designer)
   because this procedure converts only the geometry of computer-aided
   design data to VR data; everything else depends on the engineer's
   ability and experience. Consequently, there is no consistent procedure
   that reflects engineering factors such as events and properties, which
   were included in the design stage. This article introduces a rule-based
   system that creates a virtual prototype through the data of product,
   process, plant, and resource for virtual plant review and suggests a new
   procedure for virtual plant review.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the concept and discusses the implications of
   immersive journalism, which is the production of news in a form in which
   people can gain first-person experiences of the events or situation
   described in news stories. The fundamental idea of immersive journalism
   is to allow the participant, typically represented as a digital avatar,
   to actually enter a virtually recreated scenario representing the news
   story. The sense of presence obtained through an immersive system
   (whether a Cave or head-tracked head-mounted displays {[}HMD] and online
   virtual worlds, such as video games and online virtual worlds) affords
   the participant unprecedented access to the sights and sounds, and
   possibly feelings and emotions, that accompany the news. This paper
   surveys current approaches to immersive journalism and the theoretical
   background supporting claims regarding avatar experience in immersive
   systems. We also provide a specific demonstration: giving participants
   the experience of being in an interrogation room in an offshore prison.
   By both describing current approaches and demonstrating an immersive
   journalism experience, we open a new avenue for research into how
   presence can be utilized in the field of news and nonfiction.}},

Abstract = {{One of the reasons of how virtual reality applications penetrate
   industrial production chains slowly is because of significant investment
   costs to purchase adequate supporting hardware. As a consequence such
   applications are only available to major companies and fail to benefit
   the production processes of small and medium enterprises. In this
   article, we introduce PTrack, a real-time, low-cost, marker-based
   multiple camera tracking solution for virtual reality providing the
   accuracy and scalability usually found in much more expensive tracking
   systems. PTrack is composed of single camera tracking PTrack Units. Each
   unit is connected to a video camera equipped with infrared strobes and
   features a novel iterative geometric pose estimation algorithm which
   does marker-based single camera tracking and is therefore completely
   autonomous. Multiple PTrack units successively extend the tracking range
   of the system. For a smooth transition of tracked labels from one camera
   to another, camera range areas must overlap to form a contiguous
   tracking space. A PTrack Sensor Fusion Module then computes the pose of
   a certain label within tracking space and forwards it to interested
   applications. A universal test setup for optical tracking systems has
   been built allowing to measure translational and rotational accuracy of
   PTrack as well as of competing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Backward walking (B W) shows significant differences with forward

   purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of visual cues
   provided by a virtual environment on FW and BW on gait variability. Each
   subject underwent four conditions of treadmill walking at self:selected
   pace. The subjects walked backwards in three conditions and forwards in
   the fourth condition. A virtual corridor was displayed to the subjects
   in the FW condition (forward optic flow) and two of the backward
   conditions (forward and backward optic flow). The third BW condition was
   a control condition (no visual cues). Gait variability measures of the
   hip, knee and ankle range of motion and the stride interval were
   analyzed. Magnitude of variability was evaluated with the coefficient of
   variation and structure of variability with approximate entropy.
   Significant differences were demonstrated between the FW and the BW gait
   characteristics as well as in gait variability (for both magnitude and
   structure of variability). No significant differences were found between
   the three BW conditions as a result of the direction of visual cues. In
   order to get optimal benefit of BW in the aged and the diseased, optical
   flow of visual feedback may need to be manipulated in a different manner

   like the velocity of optic flow and appearance of obstacles to obtain
   the best visual cue configuration for rehabilitation.}},

   not work as a whole. For better understanding and company integration we
   look for more powerful tools for decision making in real time. Business
   flight simulators can provide company information strategy with suitable
   tools for decision making. Business flight simulators are able to create
   different ``what-if{''} scenarios and analysis. Results from company
   information systems, data warehouses and other unstructured sources
   (texts, spreadsheet programs, market behavior, economic index of other
   companies, etc.) could be used as data. All summary indexes, on the
   basis of the data history, are able to create predictions and help
   future progress. The level of strategic planning and production control
   is very closely linked with other strategic areas such as marketing,
   trade or economy. The access to real data is one of the advantages which
   can be supported by simulators and can help managers make a decision and
   see the future impact these decisions may have. The simulator can not be
   isolated but it has to be integrated into the company's information

Abstract = {{After a stroke, many survivors have impaired motor function. Robotic
   rehabilitation techniques have emerged to provide a repetitive,
   activity-based therapy at potentially lower cost than conventional
   methods. Many patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to hand extension in
   the form of spasticity and/or hypertonia. We have developed a therapy
   program using the Hand Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot (HEXORR) that is
   capable of compensating for tone to assist patients in opening the
   paretic hand. The system can move the user's hand, assist movement,
   allow free movement, or restrict movement to allow static force
   production. These options combine with an interactive virtual reality
   game to enhance user motivation. Four chronic stroke subjects received
   18 sessions of robot therapy as well as pre and post evaluation
   sessions. All subjects showed at least modest gains in active finger
   range of motion (ROM) measured in the robot, and all but one subject had
   gains in active thumb ROM. Most of these gains carried over to ROM gains
   outside of the robot. The clinical measures (Fugl-Meyer, Box-and-Blocks)
   showed clear improvements in two subjects and mixed results in two
   subjects. Overall, the robot therapy was well received by subjects and
   shows promising results. We conclude HEXORR therapy is best suited for
   patients with mild-moderate tone and at least minimal extension.}},

Abstract = {{Petrochemical industry, which adopts oil and natural gas as raw
   material, is more dangerous than any other industry on account of the
   characteristics of combustibility and explosion. The craft and process
   of production are rather complicated at the same time. Consequently, it
   is extremely perilous once the fire hazard is taken place in the
   petrochemical industry enterprises resulting in severe consequence. The
   virtual reality technique is applied in this paper to develop a computer
   simulation training system for fire fighting and rescue with regard to
   the disaster accidents of petrochemical industry in order to launch the
   tactics training for fireman and enhance the fire fighting troops'
   tactical capability of putting out petrochemical fire hazard. Such
   system simulates the 3-D scene for petrochemical plant by utilizing
   virtual reality technique. Several similar real fire hazard scenes are
   provided according to distinct accidental patterns for the purpose of
   instructing fireman to adopt correspondent fire fighting and rescue
   tactics measure. The 3-D model of 3DMAX is called in the software of
   quest3d by programming. The scene including flame, smoke and fire water
   beam is described by means of particle system modeling technique. The
   considerable investment of funds and installations, which is used to
   satisfy, the fire fighting and rescue training requirement in
   petrochemical fire hazard, can be resolved, as well as the influence on
   the enterprise production. The influence on training in conventional
   process, which is caused by the environment, meteorology, cost and so

Abstract = {{In the new digital spaces young people are creating new ways with words,
   that not only fracture the traditional hegemony of written texts but
   also create new empowering zones where youngsters dare to make their
   private thoughts public. On multiple sites (that include blogs,
   podcasts, wikis, and social networking sites) new texts and discursive
   practices are produced making these sites inherently pedagogical. As
   sites of public pedagogy they create, in turn, forms of literacy that go
   against traditional understandings of what constitutes a text. These
   texts often use language in an unorthodox way, adopt informal writing
   styles, and make use of text shortcuts and emoticons. In a sense, they
   redefine the nature and functions of language and break away from a
   rigid, grammatically and syntactically structured model that aspires to
   imitate the standard norm by creating new forms and uses. ICTs as sites
   of public pedagogy expand possibilities for language transcendence. That
   is, discourses produced in blogs, chats, online fan fiction, online
   discussions, and special interest groups, among others, don't comply
   with the restricted definition of `literacy'. In fact, through digital
   media, young people are reclaiming the authorship of their own words as
   well as their worlds since it is through their language that they can
   reconstruct their historical and cultural location. In this paper we
   claim that digital texts and discourses need to be negotiated and
   understood both as embodiments of an existing, real, social, economic,
   and cultural world and as interpretations of this world. New Information
   and Communication Technologies can be understood as discursive spaces,
   as sites of public pedagogy and thus, they demand a radical rethinking
   of how visual and visualizing technologies are produced, circulated, and
   taken up as well as how they redefine the traditional meaning of
   literacy. To take it one step further, they also call for rethinking
   ways to integrating these new texts and internet culture into school
   curriculum.
   We want to suggest that this new text production and interaction within
   virtual spaces, because it is rooted in the cultural capital and daily
   realities of students (those students who have access, with access being
   another important factor to be discussed), needs to be taken seriously,
   both as a form of self-expression and as a space with political
   potential. Because it springs from people's experience and social and
   historical location, it has the potential to become emancipatory. When
   students feel that what they bring into the classroom and virtual spaces
   (including their language) is valued, and they realize they can write
   about things that interest them in a language they feel comfortable
   with, a set of conditions for meaningful engagement is already present.
   A cautionary note needs to be made here in that the social repercussions
   of new technologies are not determined by the internal dynamics of new
   technologies themselves, but rather, by their external social
   environment. A change in the role of technology requires a change in the
   structure of society. At the same time, digital spaces offer the
   potential to expose students to new forms of apprenticeship, where they
   can sharpen their interpretive tools, and introduce them to new
   discourse communities where they can become the authors of their own
   histories.}},

   fixture design in a virtual reality (VR) based integrated system.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an approach combining the
   RBR and fuzzy comprehensive judgment method is proposed for reasoning
   suitable locating features and clamping features. Based on the reasoning
   results, a CBR method for machining fixture design is then presented.
   Findings - The paper finds that the proposed system is an efficient tool
   for machining fixture design.
   Practical implications - The proposed system enables the designers to
   perform fixture design with automated fixture locating method reasoning
   and make a new fixturing solution quickly by referencing previous design

Abstract = {{To achieve a full-scale simulation of a pyrite mine, a highly immersive

   system enabling users to walk through a virtual mine in real time,
   presenting all the behaviours present in such environment. Some of the
   problems encountered are the tunnels behaviours, including highly
   contrasted images due to the presence of the head light, narrow paths,
   elevators, sound reverberation and tunnels texture shades. The use of
   immersive virtual reality enables the generation of high-quality
   simulations, because it is possible to control several feedback
   mechanisms such as the degree of luminance of produced imagery and
   spatial sound. In this research, a projection infrastructure and
   tracking system were specified and developed, aiming at producing the
   best results for this kind of simulation. To achieve our purposes,
   distributed algorithms were developed to run in a cluster solution that
   drives a four-sided CAVE-like environment. The complete production

Title = {{Virtual history: a socially networked pedagogy of enlightenment}},
Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2010}},

Pages = {{297-307}},
Abstract = {{Background: Twenty-first-century undergraduates often find
   eighteenth-century culture difficult to access and, influenced by
   popular assumptions about the period in current media theory,
   characterise the century as individualist, underestimating the cultural
   significance of social networking in literary and political history.
   Purpose: This study set out to teach the history of social networking as
   culturally significant in the production of literary texts during the
   eighteenth century as well as to demonstrate the intellectual and
   compositional potential of today's social networking technologies. A
   virtual reconstruction of eighteenth-century London in Second Life and a
   semester project requiring the student recreation of 3D social spaces
   like coffee houses and gardens tested the uses of social networking
   tools to teach research methods and build disciplinary knowledge.
   Sources of evidence: Evidence of student learning outcomes is provided
   by three undergraduate courses in eighteenth-century culture, with 68
   students total, that participated in Second Life re-enactment
   assignments on Island 18 during the autumn of 2008 and spring of 2009.
   The results of the student projects as well as student-completed
   evaluations and self-reflective essays about their experiences using
   virtual reality to learn history are consulted. Theoretical evidence by
   scholars of new media, eighteenth-century history and education provides
   a background for the study's impetus and goals. Main argument: Virtual
   reality provides an opportunity for educators of eighteenth-century
   culture to teach students, through the reflective and critical use of
   the social networking tools Second Life makes available, the
   significance of social networking in the history of ideas of that
   period. We dismantle the generalisations of scholars working outside of
   the period who characterise the eighteenth century as a solely
   individualist era, during which singular genius defined the
   enlightenment and propose a more culturally viable model of social
   collaboration, supported by communication technologies not so different
   from twenty-first-century instant messaging, blogging, twittering and
   emailing. Conclusions: Contrary to the recent findings of humanities
   educators who claim that digital social networking tools are distracting
   undergraduates from more valuable academic writing, we find that a
   task-oriented semester project requiring the construction of 3D
   historical social spaces teaches investigative research skills,
   deterritorialises disciplinary knowledge and promotes revision as an
   ongoing process.}},

Abstract = {{Many architects, whether they are well-known or not, have developed
   essential architectural concepts and created significant works of
   architecture. The cultural implication for society, but specially their
   significance in relation to the architectural practice is enormous.
   Most of these designers did not make use of the currently so called new
   media to explore and elaborate their design ideas.
   Every design process is for all architects a process of `conversation
   with oneself'. Visualization media facilitate this process and make it
   even possible. The media record the different moments along the whole
   design process and, as a result, these visual records provide the
   designer with the necessary feedback.
   Departing from the actual state of the art regarding architectural
   visualization, but specifically avoiding the limitations of the
   exclusive use of computer modeling and rendering, the students at our
   department review and explore those ideas.
   But the context we experience architecture is changing. Not only for
   designers but also for an extensive public within our society, the
   visual media play nowadays an immense role.
   Moreover, we stay, meet and chat more and more within virtual spaces.
   How does this all relate to the exploration of architecture?
   mEYEmedia\&I is the name of the Minor offered by the Department of Media
   Studies of the Faculty of Architecture at the Delft University of
   Technology in the Netherlands.
   The Department of Media Studies and its students explore the role the
   diverse available media play during the complete design process.
   Students get also trained in the different communication and
   visualization media.
   In this paper we further elaborate the contents of the Minor:
   mEYEmedia\&I is about communication, about different ways, analogue and
   digital, to develop, evaluate and communicate design ideas.
   During the minor, important concepts and works of architecture are
   revisited by the designers themselves, now `reincarnated' in
   contemporary students. They explore and take advantage of the
   opportunities and limitations of the various at present available
   techniques.
   The combination of all these visual media -we introduce here the name
   augmented media for it-allows designers to explore space in many new,
   different ways and to better compose, develop and communicate their
   design ideas.
   In addition to the media training, the students mainly work on a media
   production. Making use of an augmented reality-like approach, they
   perform research on techniques that combine images of the real world
   with analogue and digital representations.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation in the context of engineering often focuses on very special
   details of global systems. Robot designers usually begin with the
   analysis of new actuators and joint designs. This corresponds to a
   ``bottom-up{''}-strategy in the development of simulation models. For
   classical fields of application of robotics, e.g. in production plants
   with a well defined environment this is the approved method, because it
   allows very detailed insights into the analyzed subsystems. On the other
   hand, unpredictable effects of the interaction of multiple subsystems
   may easily be overseen. In particular, nontechnical environments like in
   moon exploration tasks or in a biological environment like in forestry
   applications are hard to describe in an analytical way to integrate them
   into an analytical simulation model.
   This is why this paper presents the idea and some practical aspects of
   the development of ``Virtual Testbeds{''}. In a Virtual Testbed, the
   entire system is simulated as a whole in Virtual Reality - not only
   small subsystems of a global system. According to the requirements
   different subsystems are simulated with different levels of detail. In
   contrast to the classical ``bottom-up{''}-strategy this can be seen as a
   ``top-down{''}-approach. Therefore the employment of a multi-body
   dynamics system as a platform for the development of versatile
   simulation and testing environments is proposed. Using the examples of
   the evaluation and testing of an extraterrestrial walking exploration
   robot design and the development of a method for self-localization in
   forestry, the idea is further deepened. As a special field of attention
   the integration of a method of soil simulation as a particular
   requirement of a Virtual Testbed for walking exploration robots is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Accessibility is a growing concern in computer science. Since virtual
   information is mostly presented visually, it may seem that access for
   deaf people is not an issue. However, for prelingually deaf individuals,
   those who were deaf since before acquiring and formally learn a
   language, written information is often of limited accessibility than if
   presented in signing. Further, for this community, signing is their
   language of choice, and reading text in a spoken language is akin to
   using a foreign language. Sign language uses gestures and facial
   expressions and is widely used by deaf communities. To enabling
   efficient production of signed content on virtual environment, it is
   necessary to make written records of signs. Transcription systems have
   been developed to describe sign languages in written form, but these
   systems have limitations. Since they were not originally designed with
   computer animation in mind, in general, the recognition and reproduction
   of signs in these systems is an easy task only to those who deeply know
   the system. The aim of this work is to develop a transcription system to
   provide signed content in virtual environment. To animate a virtual
   avatar, a transcription system requires explicit enough information,
   such as movement speed, signs concatenation, sequence of each
   hold-and-movement and facial expressions, trying to articulate close to
   reality. Although many important studies in sign languages have been
   published, the transcription problem remains a challenge. Thus, a
   notation to describe, store and play signed content in virtual
   environments offers a multidisciplinary study and research tool, which
   may help linguistic studies to understand the sign languages structure
   and grammar.}},

Abstract = {{In the last years the motion capture technology is getting more and more
   common tool in realizing simulations, especially ergonomic. This
   technology ensures the simulation more interactive than using ordinary
   ergonomic analysis. The virtual reality allows user to be immersed into
   a virtual environment, where he can move and act as in a real context.
   Generally the evaluation of the user's performance, comfort, fatigue of
   the action can be done thanks to ergonomic analyses performed by
   operators who define and then analyze the theoretical trajectories of a
   standard manikin's movements.
   The mail goal of this work is the use of motion capture technologies and
   virtual environment for dynamic analysis based on real movements and
   postures of operators. The ergonomic analysis and simulation finally
   guarantee the operator's healthcare and the full respect of the safety
   ergonomic conditions; a case study for automotive assembly production

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a computerized program
   that can recognize woven fabric structures and simultaneously use the
   obtained data to 3D re-visualize the corresponding woven fabric

   Design/methodology/approach - A 2D bitmap image of woven fabric was
   initially acquired using an ordinary desktop flatbed scanner. Through
   several image-processing and analysis techniques as well as recognition
   algorithms, the weave pattern was then identified and stored in a
   digital format. The weave pattern data were then used to construct warp
   and weft yarn paths based on Peirce's geometrical model.
   Findings - By combining relevant weave parameters, including yarn sizes,
   warp and weft densities, yarn colours as well as cross-sectional shapes,
   a 3D image of yarns assembled together as a woven fabric structure is
   produced and shown on a screen through the virtual reality modelling
   language browser.
   Originality/value - Woven fabric structures can now be recognised and
   simultaneously use the obtained data to 3D re-visualize the
   corresponding woven fabric structures.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation in the context of robotic engineering often focuses on very
   special details of global systems. For example robot designers usually
   begin with the analysis of new actuators and joint designs. This
   corresponds to a ``bottom-up{''}-strategy in the development of complex
   simulation models. This is probably a good choice for classical fields
   of robotic applications, e.g. in production plants with well defined
   system states and environments, because it allows very detailed insights
   into the analyzed subsystems. On the other hand, unpredictable effects
   of the interaction of multiple subsystems may easily be overseen.
   To overcome this problem, this paper presents the idea and some
   practical aspects of the implementation of a virtual test environment
   (Virtual Testbed). In a Virtual Testbed, the entire system is simulated
   as a whole in virtual reality - not only small subsystems of a global
   system. According to requirements simulation of special subsystems is
   refined by specific simulation methods and integrated into the overall
   simulation framework. In contrast to the classical
   ``bottom-up{''}-strategy this can be seen as a ``top-down{''}-approach
   in the development of complex simulation models. Therefore a platform
   for the development of versatile simulation and testing environments is
   presented. Using the example of the evaluation and testing of an
   extraterrestrial walking exploration robot design in its Virtual
   Testbed, the idea is further deepened. As a special field of attention
   the integration of a method of soil simulation for the refinement of
   foot-ground-interaction as a particular requirement of this kind of
   simulation is described.}},

   aims at analyzing the start-up of a gas turbine used to drive the

   the coupling of the turbine with the compressor. Specifically detailed
   through bow-tie analysis, the action it refers to is the operator visual
   check of the coupling area. Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) that
   influence operators' reliability have been identified and rated for the
   specific site according to expert judgment and on site observations from
   human factor experts. The PSFs are linked to specific task deviations
   and, in relation to those and to the need to observe how they influence

Abstract = {{While there have been numerous studies concerning human perception in
   stereoscopic environments, rules of thumb for cinematography in
   stereoscopy have not yet been well-established. To that aim, we present
   experiments and results of subject testing in a stereoscopic
   environment, similar to that of a theater (i.e. large flat screen
   without head-tracking). In particular we wish to empirically identify
   thresholds at which different types of backgrounds, referred to in the
   computer animation industry as matte paintings, can be used while still
   maintaining the illusion of seamless perspective and depth for a
   particular scene and camera shot. In monoscopic synthetic imagery, any
   type of matte painting that maintains proper perspective lines, depth
   cues, and coherent lighting and textures saves in production costs while
   still maintaining the illusion of an alternate cinematic reality.
   However, in stereoscopic synthetic imagery, a 2D matte painting that
   worked in monoscopy may fail to provide the intended illusion of depth
   because the viewer has added depth information provided by stereopsis.
   We intend to observe two stereoscopic perceptual thresholds in this
   study which will provide practical guidelines indicating when to use
   each of three types of matte paintings. We ran subject tests in two
   virtual testing environments, each with varying conditions. Data were
   collected showing how the choices of the users matched the correct
   response, and the resulting perceptual threshold patterns are discussed

Abstract = {{Recently, virtual space design with high quality three-dimensional CG
   has become possible due to a rapid improvement in computer performance.
   In order to give a CG character the movement of its own, it is necessary
   to apply the motion data to the character after getting them with a
   motion capture device or by hand work. Production costs have increased
   because this is complicated work for an animator. In general, the
   character movement depends on the objects which it holds. Our idea is
   that the character does not have motion data of its own, but we give the
   character motion to the objects that it holds. We have developed a
   method for automatically generating the character motion data by giving
   motion information to the objects. Thus, each object includes the motion
   data that cause the character to act. In addition, we give multiple
   motion data appropriate for the situations to the objects and define the
   relationship between objects in a virtual space. By using this relation,
   we can generate a variety of motion data according to the object which
   the character holds. The proposed method reduces the number of character
   motion data which should be prepared beforehand.}},

Abstract = {{Few production virtual environment (VE) applications involve complex
   three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Our long-term collaboration with
   architects and engineers in designing 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) has
   revealed some of the causes: existing interaction tasks and/or
   techniques are either too generic when isolated from the application
   context, or too specific to be reusable. We propose a new design
   approach called domain-specific design (DSD) that sits between the
   generic and specific design approaches, with an emphasis on using domain
   knowledge in 3D interaction techniques. We also describe an interaction
   design framework encompassing generic, domain-specific, and
   application-specific interaction tasks and techniques. This framework
   can be used by designers to think of ways to produce domain-specific
   interaction techniques. We present a particular DSD method, and
   demonstrate its use for the design of cloning techniques in a structural
   engineering application. Results from empirical studies demonstrate that
   interaction techniques produced with domain knowledge in mind
   outperformed other techniques by improving task efficiency, work flow,
   and usefulness of the 3D UI.}},

   system reconstructs a visual hull from acquired multiple videos and then
   generates final videos from the model by referring to the camera shots
   used in film-making. The proposed method utilizes ``Reliability{''} to
   compensate for errors that may have occurred in non-studio environments

   using a virtual camera control system, even non-experts can easily
   convert the 3D model to movies that look as if they were created by

Abstract = {{In ITER, maintenance operations in the vessel and in the Hot Cell will
   be largely done by Remote Handling (RH). Remotely performed maintenance
   actions tend to be more time-costly than actions performed by direct
   human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate
   situational feedback, a two-armed master slave manipulator system can
   mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and
   vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting
   the design for simplified maintenance operations can yield significant
   time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust
   design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design
   For Assembly (DFA).
   This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be
   applied to simplify maintenance operations for ITER. While DFA is
   normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product. it is
   possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER maintenance operations.
   Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction
   levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new
   insights and provides additional value. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multiple-camera systems are currently widely used in research and

   content. Studio systems for 3-D production of human performance are
   reviewed from the literature, and the practical experience gained in
   developing prototype studios is reported across two research
   laboratories. System design should consider the studio backdrop for
   foreground matting, lighting for ambient illumination, camera
   acquisition hardware., the camera configuration for scene capture, and
   accurate geometric and photometric camera calibration. A ground-truth
   evaluation is performed to quantify the effect of different constraints
   on the multiple-camera system in terms of geometric accuracy and the
   requirement for high-quality view synthesis. As changing camera height
   has only a limited influence on surface visibility, multiple-camera sets
   or an active vision system may be required for wide area capture, and
   accurate reconstruction requires a camera baseline of 25 degrees, and
   the achievable accuracy is 5-10-mm at current camera resolutions.
   Accuracy is inherently limited, and view-dependent rendering is required
   for view synthesis with sub-pixel accuracy where display resolutions
   match camera resolutions. The two prototype studios are contrasted and

Title = {{An approach to simulate cold roll-forging of turbo-engine thin
   compressor blade}},
Journal = {{AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{191-198}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Studying manufacturing process of compressor blade can reduce
   the production cost and time in aircraft turbo-engine industries. In the
   cold roll-forging of thin compressor blades, the elastic behavior of
   machine structure and rolls is considerable due to the higher volume of
   roll separating force. Owing to this kind of elastic deformation during
   rolling, the adjusted gap between the rolling dies is increased and this
   causes unexpected flow of material, shape and thickness. The purpose of
   this paper is to present a new approach for simulation of cold rolling
   of thin blades and studying the effect of elastic behavior of the
   machine structure as well as rolls deflection on the material flow and
   roll separating force.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the process has been
   investigated using experimental test and simulation by introducing a new
   approach in a decision-making flowchart. Instead of simulating of the
   entire system structure, a couple of virtual deformable rolls are
   suggested. The specifications of these rolls are selected to behave
   elastically during rolling same as whole roll stand. In addition, the
   thickness values are compared in both experiment and simulation. Also,
   the roll separating force is compared with and without using this
   approach.
   Findings - A decision-making algorithm has been presented that can be
   used to study the process. This finding provides the basis to
   investigate the effect of elastic deformation of machine structure and
   rolls on dimensional accuracy and roll force.
   Originality/value - Result of this work can promote the position of
   simulation of the thin rolled sections to an extent more compatible with
   reality. For instance, the amount of increased gap between two dies
   during rolling can be estimated accurately. Also the influence of this
   gap on final blade thickness and the roll force and on the roll torque
   can be investigated by this approach.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematics is the universal language of human abstract thought and it
   subtly pervades all forms of Art. Art and Mathematics have evolved in
   parallel, alongwith changes in our ways of conceiving, perceiving,
   experimenting and representing ``reality{''}. One can divide this
   evolution into four steps. The first refers to Classical Art; a second
   to the development of Perspective; a third one to non-Euclidean
   Geometry; a fourth to ``Synthetic Geometry{''} and the deconstruction of
   rigid forms, with the development of fractals and topology alongwith
   modern and avant-garde forms of Art. In the era of Digital Art a
   skillful use of Web and Computer Technologies, alongwith Multimediality,
   offers new challenging ways to introduce Mathematics starting from a
   careful reading of artworks. We have therefore elaborated, proposed and
   begun experimenting an innovative ``teaching and visualization
   project{''} mainly based on advanced techniques at the intersection of
   Mathematics, Computer Science and Digital Art. The project called
   ``SCIENAR{''} - is based the innovative possibilities that new media
   offer for a better Communication, Visualization, Divulgation and
   Didactics of Mathematics. It aims to creating three scientific scenarios
   concerning the theory of Relativity, the notion of Symmetries and the
   foundations of Geometry; starting from these it will be possible to
   produce artistic objects by means of a collaborative work between
   researchers, scientists and artists. ``SCIENAR{''} will generate a fully
   innovative portal, whereby artists will find ready-to-use mathematical
   forms, including the more traditional Web Portal ``MArs{''}. Next steps
   will be aimed at fostering, stimulating and supporting the physical and
   the virtual mobility of artists and cultural players interested to use
   mathematical models for the production of artistic objects, improving
   links among single artists, cultural operators, scientists and experts
   in digital technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-scale geological models contain three-dimensional, spatially
   referenced data, typically spanning at least six orders of magnitude
   from outcrop to regional scale. A large number of different geological
   and geophysical data sources can be combined into a single model.
   Established 3D visualisation methods that are widely used in hydrocarbon
   exploration and production for sub-surface data have been adapted for
   onshore surface geology through a combination of methods for digital
   data acquisition, 3D visualisation, and geospatial analysis. The
   integration of georeferenced data across a wider than normal range in
   scale helps to address several of the existing limitations that are
   inherent in traditional methods of map production and publishing. The
   primary advantage of a multi-scale approach is that spatial precision
   and dimensionality (which are generally degraded when data are displayed
   in 2D at a single scale) can be preserved at all scales.
   Real-time, immersive, interactive software, based on a ``3D
   geospatial{''} graphical user interface (GUI), allows complex geological
   architectures to be depicted, and is more inherently intuitive than
   software based on a standard ``desktop{''} GUI metaphor. The continuing
   convergence of different kinds of geo-modelling, GIS, and visualisation
   software, as well as industry acceptance of standardised middleware, has
   helped to make multi-scale geological models a practical reality. This
   is illustrated with two case studies from NE England and NW Scotland.

Abstract = {{The combination of Discrete Event Systems with 3D simulation and control
   technology to set up versatile virtual environments seems to be at the
   first glance a contradiction in terms because of mixing up two totally
   different application classes. But here, the newly developed State
   Oriented Modeling methodology comes into play providing a comprehensive
   and flexible object oriented framework for the development of complex
   Discrete Event Systems. State Oriented Modeling establishes a link
   between these two worlds using object oriented Petri Nets {[}10] for the
   discrete part as well as application specific mappings between
   continuous and discrete state variables realizing so called 3D Discrete
   Event Systems. Integrated in a versatile 3D simulation system, State
   Oriented Modeling allows for the efficient realization of a large class
   of applications within the large field of virtual environments. It
   provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use but nevertheless efficient
   framework for behavior modeling in virtual worlds and real-time
   simulation applications. When modeling virtual production lines for
   example, State Oriented Modeling provides an easy way for a
   close-to-reality simulation of automation systems starting with the
   control of simple actuators or sensors and ending with the supervisory
   control of the entire virtual factory. In the field of Projective
   Virtual Reality {[}4] State Oriented Modeling supervises the user's work
   in the virtual environment to derive his ``intention{''} and then
   generates appropriate command sequences for intelligent automation
   hardware. This way, even complex automation systems which may be far
   away or even in space can be controlled - and the user must not be an
   automation expert. In the field of interactive visualization and
   training environments State Oriented Modeling simulates a variety of
   dynamic objects in the virtual world, integrates interaction components
   like 2D control elements or application specific driver seats into the
   virtual environment and supervises training sessions to derive
   performance indicators. And, in addition to this, State Oriented
   Modeling is the basis for a new multi-agent and discrete event based
   approach to realize the virtual human.}},

Abstract = {{Today, in production engineering we have already taken into usage
   complex virtual representations of the manufacturing environment were we
   can program, simulate, analyse and optimise key performances. Such
   systems are mainly working through keyboard/mouse input while user
   feedback normally are direct visual through computer screen and text
   files. Such communication only relays on a limited spectre of our senses
   and the keyboard/mouse/screen systems cannot be said to be very human
   friendly, especially when the operator is expected to operate ``out of
   office{''} in a unstructured, maybe dangerous or dirty, environment. In
   the near future we expect to see more advanced input/output devices like
   motion capturing and speech input systems while feedback will not be
   visual alone but include several other human senses. Combinatorial
   sensory information, interpreted by the human brain, becomes very handy
   when a stand alone sense is not enough to interpret the actual
   situation.
   Imitation of senses and feedback from virtual reality environments
   always meant a great problem. Realization of two (sight and hearing) out
   of the five human senses is indispensable. Simulation of these two
   senses is not complex issue; on the contrary the other three are quite
   challenging. This paper describes the development of a vibro-tactile
   glove which can provide sensory feedback from a virtual environment,
   either as a stand alone system but most important in combination with
   sight and audio feedback systems. Instead of implementing real force
   feedback, the focus is on tactile sensing, as an alternative way of
   achieving the same feedback. The glove contains six vibration motors on
   different locations on the hand. These locations include all five
   fingers, and the palm. Communication with the glove is wireless,
   enabling free movement for the user. The system is low cost and very
   small sized which allows for combining it with advanced input devices
   like a motion capturing suit.}},

Abstract = {{Today using computer technology simulation software and modeling
   techniques have increased not only the quality but also the production
   types. Finally a red 3D model with all its properties will be made and
   tested. With this new tool, physical properties and dynamic properties
   will be evaluated and tested. Different tools are available to design 3D
   objects such as; simulation, virtual manufacturing tool (VM), virtual
   prototyping tool (VP). Finally; using a new tool is called virtual
   reality which is used for industrial virtual Manufacturing tool (IVM).
   In this paper we have designed a software with its hardware tool which
   demos a virtual street and the hardware system including, steering
   wheel, accelerator and brake pedal with a polarized glasses and sound
   system with respect to their functions. This real 3D model can help the
   user to drive in a virtual street with real sense. This is a cost
   effective system tool for training, modeling evaluation, and education.
   This technique can be implement for any other training systems such as
   chemical labs, mechanical and virtual classes.}},

Abstract = {{A complex system is a system made up of a great number of entities in
   local and simultaneous interaction. Its design requires the
   collaboration of engineers of various complementary specialties, so that
   it is necessary to invent new design methods. Indeed, currently the
   industry loses much time between the moment when the product model is
   designed and when the latter is serially produced on the lines of
   factories. This production is generally ensured by automated and more
   often robotized means. A deadline is thus necessary for the development
   of the automatisms and the robots work on a new product model. In this
   context we launched a study based on the principle of the mechatronics
   design in Augmented Reality-Virtual Reality. This new approach will
   bring solutions to problems encountered in many application scopes, but
   also to problems involved in the distance which separates the offices
   from design of vehicles and their production sites. This new approach
   will minimize the differences of errors between the design model and
   real prototype.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that use of a true 3D display providing easy
   visualization of patient anatomy and dose distribution would lead to the
   production of better quality radiation therapy treatment plans. We
   report on a randomized prospective multi-institutional study to evaluate
   a novel 3D display for treatment planning.
   The Perspecta (R) Spatial 3D System produces 360 holograms by projecting
   cross-sectional images on a diffuser screen rotating at 900 rpm.
   Specially-developed software allows bi-directional transfer of image and
   dose data between Perspecta and the Pinnacle planning system.
   Thirty-three patients previously treated at three institutions were
   included in this IRB-approved study. Patient data were de-identified,
   randomized, and assigned to different planners. A physician at each
   institution reviewed the cases and established planning objectives. Two
   treatment plans were then produced for each patient, one based on the
   Pinnacle system alone and another in conjunction with Perspecta. Plan
   quality was then evaluated by the same physicians who established the
   planning objectives. All plans were viewable on both Perspecta and
   Pinnacle for review. Reviewing physicians were blinded to the planning
   device used. Data from a 13-patient pilot study were also included in
   the analysis.
   Perspecta plans were considered better in 28 patients (61\%), Pinnacle
   in 14 patients (30\%), and both were equivalent in 4 patients. The use
   of non-coplanar beams was more common with Perspecta plans (82\% vs.
   27\%). The mean target dose differed by less than 2\% between rival
   plans. Perspecta plans were somewhat more likely to have the hot spot
   located inside the target (43\% vs. 33\%). Conversely, 30\% of the
   Pinnacle plans had the hot spot outside the target compared with 18\%
   for Perspecta plans. About 57\% of normal organs received less dose from
   Perspecta plans. No statistically significant association was found
   between plan preference and planning institution or planner.
   The study found that use of the holographic display leads to
   radiotherapy plans preferred in a majority of cases over those developed
   with 2D displays. These data indicate that continued development of this
   technology for clinical implementation is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{In today's competitive environment it has become commonplace for
   foundries to incorporate capabilities such as component design, part
   assembly and other non-traditional foundry operations. To predict the
   behavior of a casting component under service conditions, value-added
   functionality has also been integrated into engineering software by
   linking solutions together and adding multi-physics analyses into the
   design cycle.
   The structural simulation of safety components made of die cast alloys
   is frequently based on the assumption of a homogenous distribution of
   mechanical properties. In reality defects caused by the production
   process like porosity is one of the most degrading factors leading to
   nonhomogenous mechanical properties. In order to predict the behavior of
   the part under service conditions, it is necessary to take into account
   the influence of the porosity distribution resulting from the casting
   process into the structural simulation. This production part is then
   used in a performance analysis, such as crash or impact, to observe how
   the as-cast part will perform in its actual usage.
   This paper describes a methodology to model the complete High Pressure
   Die Casting (HPDC) process, determine macro and micro porosity results
   and then map these porosity results onto a geometry which can be used
   for a crash/impact analysis. The porosity map leads to a more correct
   description of the mechanical strength of the component, which then
   leads to more accurate virtual component testing. These results will be
   compared to the experimentally measured porosity distribution in the
   actual part, as well as actual loading cases to observe the deflection
   and failure of the component. This type of advanced technology and
   predictive engineering is the next giant step in the software industry.}},

Abstract = {{The approach of machine tool design is contradictory with the usual view
   on production upgrading, because the implementation of integration in
   the machining process is limited and such, production control and
   maintenance of the machines are more significant at the beginning than
   automation of machining process. A possible solution to these problems
   is the integration of the machining process control with the activities
   of preventive maintenance in the early phases of product design or
   machine tool design, and technology.
   For the control and support the simulation technique is used, based on
   the technologies such as: virtual reality, visual simulation, use of
   neural, fuzzy and genetic algorithms etc. For real time-maintenance, new
   sensors, coupled with knowledge-based systems, will make it possible to
   automate the diagnosis of routine machine tool failures.
   It is obvious that this approach is an intermediary step which assure
   enough time for expert system technology to mature and to be included as
   a built-in component of a machine tool. In such a way the reduction of
   production costs, shortening of flow times, production based on the
   clients' orders and considerable shortening of product development cycle

Abstract = {{Background: Although there are many studies linking the religious
   context with fisical and mental health, there is little research on the
   interface between religiousness/spirituality and personality.
   Objectives: The main goal was to review the empirical research on the
   relationship between religiosity, spirituality and personality. Methods:
   A survey of the academic production through virtual databases: PubMed
   and PsychInfo, published until January of 2008 and using the
   combinations: ``personality and spiritu(star){''} and ``personality and
   religio(star){''} was conducted, in addition to articles presented in a
   meta-analysis about the subject. Results: High Religiousness is
   associated with low Psychoticism and high Agreeableness and
   Conscientiousness. Conscientiousness in adolescents can be a significant
   predictor for the higher religiosity in the early adulthood. And the
   dimension of Religiosity seems to be a potentially candidate to be
   beyond the Big Five. Discussion: The belief in a dimension of
   Religiosity, in a transcendent reality or in a personal God, in some
   cases, does not seem to show associations between any of the five
   factors of personality. This can indicate that the R/E is a potential
   sixth factor of personality that is not present in the current models of
   personality.}},

Abstract = {{One of the important tasks in Mechanical Engineering is to increase the

   typically solved by means of Multiobjective Optimization, which
   formulates the problem as a mapping from the space of design variables
   to the space of target criteria and tries to find an optimal region in
   these multidimensional spaces. Due to high computational costs of
   numerical simulations, the sampling of this mapping is usually very
   sparse and scattered. Combining design of experiments methods,
   metamodeling, new interpolation schemes and innovative graphics methods,
   we enable the user to interact with simulation parameters, optimization
   criteria, and come to a new interpolated crash result within seconds. We
   denote this approach as Simulated Reality, a new concept for the
   interplay between simulation, optimization and interactive
   visualization. In this paper we show the application of Simulated

Abstract = {{The idea of progress has been associated with a certain version of
   progressivism which stems from directional transformation, which means
   the change from a given state to another one. Therefore, a practical
   interpretation embraces leaving the state of primary cultural poverty,
   ignorance, and sense of being lost to higher levels of civilization. The
   idea of progress still plays pivotal roles in the development of modern
   medicine, which has triumphed for many years. To make real rules that
   present the heart of the idea of progress is possible only when
   civilizational progress has earlier come true. So it is not possible to
   gain innovations (in fact, they are the markers of progress) in medicine
   without cultural development, appearance of new technology, and social
   development. The internet is a worldwide network of connected computers
   which cooperate with each other at the level of data transfer.
   Physicians are a part of modern society or postmodern society, and like
   the rest of humans, they are changed similarly to others. Additionally,
   physicians bear responsibility for a high quality of work. The internet
   appears to be a good medium to exchange information which can be used
   for interpersonal communication, entertainment, education, business
   activity or industrial production purposes. Professional internet
   portals give possibilities to make a virtual reality that is able to
   exist due to a virtual community. The latter consists of real humans
   working in various professions, for instance physicians. An individual
   person (e.g. a physician) is a part of the professional network. Further
   individual progress ensures that a given physician will be a crucial

Abstract = {{Near-to-eye displays (NEDs) provide a unique way to perceive a larger
   image than the device itself. The user acceptance of commercially
   available NEDs has not been high partly because of reported
   physiological symptoms. Devices also tend to be thick and heavy, and
   therefore uncomfortable to wear. To overcome these shortcomings and to
   make a very usable device, a new approach was needed. By using very thin
   plastic light guides with diffractive structures on the surfaces, many
   of the known obstacles can be notably reduced. These exit pupil
   expanders (EPEs) enable a light and thin design for see-through NEDs.
   The so-called chevron EPE was designed to further improve the design and
   usability aspects of NEDs. The diffractive EPE has typically one
   incoupling grating area that delivers light into the light guide
   symmetrically towards the left and right eyes. By using slanted or
   overhanging gratings, the incoupling is very asymmetric. If the
   incoupling area is divided into two parts, each having opposite slanting
   angles, the EPE plate can be cut in half, and the left and right parts
   can be separated. The plates can be further tilted to a chevron shape
   following more closely the human face and mimicking the conventional
   eyeglass design. The reflection of the light from the tilted plate is
   directed out from the image-forming optics, and therefore the contrast
   is improved. The privacy of the usage is improved because at the output
   the secondary beams are harder to observe. Because the device is brought
   closer to face, it enables better weight balance. The chevron geometry
   partially prevents the ambient light from the sides to enter the
   diffractive structures, and thus the unwanted reflections are also
   reduced. Furthermore, the half-size of the chevron EPE parts from the
   undivided EPE results in a better production yield.}},

Abstract = {{Losing oneself in a story, a film or a picture is nothing but another
   step in the suspension of disbelief that permits one to become immersed
   in the `novel' of reality. It is not by chance that the text-world
   metaphor informs classical aesthetics that, more than anything else,
   emphasizes emotional involvement. On the contrary, as in much of modern
   art, self-reflexivity and metafictional attention to the rhetoric of the
   real, to the framework, to the conventions and to the processes of
   meaning production, all involve a disenchanted, detached and sceptic
   vision - in short, an aesthetics of the text as game. By analogy, any
   analytic style or model that aims to produce a transformative experience
   must satisfactorily resolve the conflict between immersion (the
   analyst's emotional participation and sticking to the dreamlike or
   fictional climate of the session, dreaming knowing it's a dream) and
   interactivity (for the most part, interpretation as an anti-immersive
   device that `wakes' one from fiction and demystifies consciousness). In
   analytic field theory the setting can be defined - because of the weight
   given to performativity of language, to the sensory matrix of the
   transference and the transparency of the medium - the place where an
   ideal balance is sought between immersion and interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Desktop computers based virtual training systems are attracting
   paramount attention from manufacturing industries due to their potential
   advantages over the conventional training practices. Significant cost

   by using computer based virtual reality (VR) training systems, the time
   span from the product design to commercial production can be shortened

   conceptual framework, a haptically enabled interactive and immersive

   the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by
   providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the
   physical limitations of the real world imposed by the haptics devices
   within the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing
   VR systems, capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly

Abstract = {{Garment fit is an emotive subject as it embraces all the senses,
   physical and emotional, significantly impacting on feelings and
   self-worth. Clothing is worn in every situation utilizing many design
   and production processes. According to a recent survey, undertaken by
   Kurt Solomon Associates (Munro and Curran 2007), 70\% of women say they
   have difficulty in finding clothes that fit well. It was suggested that
   data acquired by sizing surveys would bring about new standard sizes for
   improved fit, and thereby reduce garment returns. However this has not
   been the case. The new technologies of Virtual fit, 3D design to 2D
   pattern flattening and CAD 2D pattern design have not been able to
   produce well fitting garments. Ultimately the quality of fit is always
   dependant on the ability of pattern drafting procedure to truly
   represent the underlying body shape and proportions, irrespective of the
   garment style. This paper visits pattern design and clothing fit
   solutions to date and discusses the implications of making the fit

Abstract = {{Modeling and simulation is a powerful tool able to address complex
   decision making process: it allows the responsible to infer the effect
   of a decision well in advance and to avoid excessive risky decisions. In
   literature there several Simulation Methodologies are described, in
   particular Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is the traditional paradigm
   used for model manufacturing processes, in such view the problem is
   describe in term of Entities (nouns), Resources and Activities (verbs).
   Several application examples of such vision can be identified in the
   Steel industry, we have models of steel melting process, of steel
   rolling mills and of steel treatments. Generally speaking these examples
   rely on a very hi-fidelity hi-detailed model of the production process
   that requires a very deep knowledge of the process in order to be
   properly applied. There are, however, another class of modeling
   methodologies that are more suitable for strategic planning evaluation
   rather than for operative/tactical simulations; in such approaches the
   experimenter create an approximate model of the systems in order to
   investigate, at a very high level, what could happened to the system in
   specific cases (scenario simulation). The focus of the simulation is
   then the robustness of a solution rather that its performances, in
   literature these example have been extensively presented and discussed:
   they are known under various names: Monte-Carlo Simulations, Risk
   Analysis Tools, Strategic Simulations, Worksheet Simulations and many
   others. The basic concept underlying this methodology is founded on the
   creation and evaluation of several scenario according to specific
   multi-disciplinary criteria: a long term investment plan in the steel
   industry could be tested against the occurrence of several events
   (market growth, economy recession, new players appearances, etc.). The
   simulator creates and evaluate thousands of different ``stories{''} each
   one carrying one or more occurrences and test the response of the
   stimulated system to these ``events{''}. In the following bulleted list
   is possible to identify possible application of such methodology:
   Product mix decisions where demand and resource requirements for each
   product are uncertain
   Optimal inventory ordering decisions where product demand is uncertain
   Capacity planning and optimal configuration of plant capacities when
   faced with uncertain demand for a new product
   Capital budgeting and project selection when resources required for
   available projects are uncertain
   Optimal cash management policy where cash inflows are uncertain
   Capacity planning for utilities where power usage and power prices are
   uncertain
   Timing market entry decisions where market growth is uncertain,
   including the possibility of reduced market share due to late entry and
   danger of limited market growth
   Making test-marketing decisions that maximize product profitability in
   the face of uncertain demand
   Anandalingam (1987) proposed the process model of the Indian iron and
   steel industry with particular focus on energy use and conservation
   possibilities. Uncertainty problems in the industry where analyzed by
   using probabilistic MonteCarlo simulations, where model parameters where
   modeled to be stochastic and distributed normally. There is another type
   of simulation that build on top of the Theory of Systems developed by
   MIT Professor Jay W. Forrester at the Sloan School of Management, this
   approach is known as System Dynamics and could be used to create
   Decisions Cockpits able to dynamically evaluate the effect of a
   strategical decision. Based on the case of a two-echelon steel has been
   working in the development of the mentioned software above all in the
   Windows, Linux and Mac environments by acquiring experience on the main
   applications and office automation packs. He makes use and develops
   models in virtual reality for the Virtual Design by exploiting also
   Web-Oriented graphic environments (Atmosphere, Java 3D, Blender, Vega
   Prime, Multigen-Creator). On March 2004 he wins the Competition for the
   role of Associated Professor at the University of Parma. He is, as well,

Pages = {{807-828}},
Abstract = {{The ability to combine tactile, on-the-skin, sensory cues with the
   kinesthetic ones that widely available force-feedback devices are able
   to produce is a desirable one, opening the door to the production of
   more realistic, compelling virtual environments. Pneumatic air-jet
   displays can be easily mounted on existing force-feedback devices and we
   believe have the potential to provide useful complimentary tactile
   information. However, there is little concrete psychophysical data
   relating to pneumatic displays - a fact that hinders their adoption.
   This paper addresses this challenge, and presents brief psychophysical
   studies examining localization rate, the two-point threshold and the
   stimulus intensity of cues produced by pneumatic air jets. Using
   insights gained from these studies, we also present a more concrete
   application-focused investigation where we evaluate the effect of
   combining tactile and force-feedback cues in a simple object
   manipulation task in a virtual environment. We show that task completion
   times are significantly improved with the addition of tactile
   information, validating our ideas and suggesting this topic warrants
   further attention. (c) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden and The Robotics

Abstract = {{This paper describes the production process of 3D maps at Tele Atlas.
   Starting from a 2D City map which contains relevant features by their
   outline, 3D City maps are created by adding height to the outlines of
   buildings and other objects. Further enhancements are made by adding
   roof representations and facade textures. These textures can either be
   an exact representation of the facade or be composed of predefined
   elements from a library which leads to significant data size reductions.
   In the production process, Mobile Mapping a technology developed at Tele
   Atlas plays an important role. It serves to collect building heights and
   facade textures and components. To date this has resulted in the
   availability of 3D City maps of 12 cities with important extension
   planned for 2008. The paper ends by stating that whereas the original
   reason to develop 3D maps stems from a desire to improve the riser
   interface of navigation and other Intelligent Transport applications, it
   is likely that 3D models will have growing significance in future also
   for in-car safety systems.}},

Abstract = {{The changing demographics of the mining industry make successful passing
   of knowledge and skills to the next generation critical. Training
   methods and technologies are being developed to meet this need. Twenty
   years ago classroom training was largely a one-way transfer of knowledge
   through instructor lectures. In contrast, instructors today can use
   virtual reality technologies to guide trainees as they fully participate
   in learning experiences. Trainees can interact with the virtual work
   environment, co-workers, and equipment without being exposed to
   workplace hazards. The speed of advancement in mine safety, health, and
   production training shows no sign of slowing in the next 20 years.
   Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
   have studied and participated in the evolution of miner training. A look
   at training materials they have created in the past and those they are
   currently developing reveals changes in methods and technologies over
   time and also key characteristics which have remained constant.
   Possibilities for the future can be discussed in the framework of an
   implementation of virtual reality in new miner training sessions. The
   example computer-based training package teaches new miners to read mine
   maps and provides opportunity to practice navigation skills in it
   virtual mine. With this `serious game', trainees experience the look and
   feel of moving through an underground coal mine while in the safety of
   their classroom. During field-testing in 2007, trainees and instructors
   responded very favourably to this new way of learning. The software was
   usable by mine trainers with even limited computer expertise and could
   be installed on the affordable computers they were using for their more
   traditional slide presentations. The Underground Coal Mine Map Reading
   Training's foundation on past successful development strategies and its
   acceptance by today's instructors and trainees provide valuable lessons
   for developing training materials, strategies, and technologies for
   mining's future.}},

Abstract = {{German hard coal mining operations have decreased for more than 40
   years. Current political decisions are leading to a discontinuation of
   subsidised black coal mining by the year 2018. This decision will,
   however, be reviewed once again in the year 2012. The enormous increases
   in productivity, which were achieved in previous years, have so far not
   led to an achievement of market requirements. Coal mining at depth of
   more than 1200 in in multiple seam environments is not yet competitive
   in global comparison. In 2009 the 24 faces left in eight mines produced
   about 20 million tonnes of usable steam coal. Management and the
   workforce will be reduced in parallel; from today until 2012 by more
   than half. The average age of personnel is increasing dramatically and
   nearly no new personnel are recruited.
   With this background in mind, increasing continuously coal mining
   productivity becomes more and more difficult. Above all, this goal was
   reached by mechanisation, then by increasing the mining machine power
   and then by enhanced machine control systems. The first attempts to
   automatically operate full face equipment from above ground were in the
   early 1980s. After successful automation of the face equipment, the
   emphasis is now on mine logistics. Autonomous monorail transport was
   introduced and tested in 2007. Since the development rate of machine
   improvements has its limits, the focus is on the full interaction of the
   total production system. Here information technology (IT) becomes
   important; the driver for more productivity.
   Actual developments aim for the complete and general homogeneous IT
   infrastructure both above ground as well its underground. The explosive
   environment needs high level investments in safe technology, cl; access
   points for WLAN and fibre optics for underground use (ATEX
   certification). New technology availability also drives the enhancements
   of management and process control systems.
   Innovations in the mining industry often comprise technology advances
   through the adoption of well-known technologies. With virtual reality
   (VR) leaching and training systems advanced computational instruments,
   both in software and hardware development, were applied in the German
   coal mining industry for ten years. Widening lists of applications as
   well as the encouraging achievements show the economical benefits of
   investing in virtual reality technology both for leaching and training
   and for knowledge management.
   The paper discusses the actual technical achievements as well as in IT
   infrastructure utilisation and also in employment of virtual reality
   based systems. Special focus and deeper insight will be given to the
   fibre optics and WLAN hardware integration as well as Software
   developments. The pocket personal computer (PC) is used to enhance
   underground material transport and data acquisition. The knowledge-based
   maintenance system (KBMS) integrates real-time virtual reality knowledge
   elements, such as repair process descriptions. It gives access to expert
   documentation by intelligent search algorithms and 3D representations of
   major mining machinery.}},

Abstract = {{Despite decades of societal investment in artificial learning systems,
   truly ``intelligent{''} systems have yet to be realized. These
   traditional models are based on input-output pattern optimization and/or
   cognitive production rule modeling. One response has been social
   robotics, using the interaction of human and robot to capture important
   cognitive dynamics such as cooperation and emotion; to date, these
   systems still incorporate traditional learning algorithms. More
   recently, investigators are focusing on the core assumptions of the
   brain ``algorithm{''} itself-trying to replicate uniquely
   ``neuromorphic{''} dynamics such as action potential spiking and
   synaptic learning. Only now are large-scale neuromorphic models becoming
   feasible, due to the availability of powerful supercomputers and an
   expanding supply of parameters derived from research into the brain's
   interdependent electrophysiological, metabolomic and genomic networks.
   Personal computer technology has also led to the acceptance of
   computer-generated humanoid images, or ``avatars{''}, to represent
   intelligent actors in virtual realities. In a recent paper, we proposed
   a method of virtual neurorobotics (VNR) in which the approaches above
   (social-emotional robotics, neuromorphic brain architectures, and
   virtual reality projection) are hybridized to rapidly forward-engineer
   and develop increasingly complex, intrinsically intelligent systems. In
   this paper, we synthesize our research and related work in the field and
   provide a framework for VNR, with wider implications for research and
   practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In the past years, a variety of Augmented Reality (AR)-based
   applications were created, aiming to support industrial processes.
   Although these first demonstrator applications or prototypes cover all
   parts of the industrial product process - design, planning and
   production, service and maintenance - only a few of them actually turned
   into established and applied solutions. Reasons for this lack of
   acceptance are - amongst others - their insufficient usability and
   accuracy.
   One crucial step in the accuracy chain for an Augmented Reality system
   is the registration of real and virtual world. This paper presents
   different approaches for industrial registration, which are being
   investigated in the context of an Augmented Reality based factory
   planning application. The resulting toolbox promises to be helpful and
   valuable for general application in industrial AR. To support the choice
   for an optimal registration method for a given scenario, the toolbox is
   currently being evaluated according to usability and accuracy criteria.
   The current state of this evaluation as well as future planned studies
   are also outlined here.}},

   Accordingly, the present study has developed a tool for an overall
   support for manufactures from the shortening of a period required for
   designing production systems to the evaluation of workload. Virtual
   reality (VR) is used in this tool. The PC screen displays a virtual work
   area and a human model (mannequin) designed by CAD. The system designer
   (operator) operates the keyboard and mouth to have the human model
   perform an assembly operation. When the assembly operation is replayed,
   an explanation is added and work procedures are prepared. Furthermore,
   work postures are calculated simultaneously. Then workload is calculated
   from the work postures. For the evaluation of workload,the OWAS
   method-based evaluation standard is used. An application verifies the
   function and validity of this tool.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade the competitive environment of manufacturing
   enterprises has changed considerably (Stalk and Hout, 1992). An initial
   emphasis on quality became the baseline from which to compete since high
   levels of quality quickly became taken for granted by customers, The
   focus of competitive attention then became those of reducing delivery
   lead time and improving delivery reliability (Bernard. 2004). In more
   recent years the provision of increasing levels of product choice and
   continuous reductions in costs have been added to the competitive mix.
   There is now increasing pressure on suppliers to provide higher levels
   of cost, quality and delivery performance in addition to ensuring the
   availability of a wider choice of products.
   An essential methodology, increasingly being adopted by manufacturing
   organisations, that is capable of assisting manufacturing organisations
   in fulfilling these competitive demands is that of lean production which
   has been shown to provide (Monden 1983, Womack, Jones and Roos 1990,
   Smeds 1990, Yusuf 2002) significant advantages in the critical areas of
   shortening lead times, improving delivery reliability, reducing costs,
   improving quality, and widening product mixes.
   Studies have shown that organisations making use of lean production
   techniques tend to have significant performance advantages over
   conventionally organised plants (Smeds 1990, Schonberger 1992. Chappell
   2002). There is also research that has reported the limitations of the
   lean philosophy, most notably Burgelman, (1993), who argues that
   environmental and social conditions have not been taken fully into
   consideration in explaining the use of lean production in Japan's
   competitive advantage. However, it is generally accepted that lean
   manufacturing practices have the ability to provide improvements in the
   majority of those areas considered critical to the competitiveness of an
   organisation.
   The paper will discuss a collaborative R\&D project which will
   accelerate the adoption and use of lean practices within a wide range of
   industrial and service sectors. A Virtual Discrete Event Process
   Simulation (V-DEPS) tool will be developed capable of providing a
   learning, training and decision support environment for lean
   practitioners from complete novices to experienced lean champions. Novel
   virtual process modelling, discrete event simulation, advanced
   visualisation and adaptive optimisation tools will be developed that
   enable self-organisation of improvement teams, and provide assistance
   with identifying \& prioritising problems, creative problem solving \&
   autonomous decision-making and lean solution optimisation \&
   implementation.}},

Pages = {{1303-1329}},
Abstract = {{Today practically all aspects of reservoir engineering problems are
   solved with a reservoir simulator. The use of the simulators is so
   extensive that it will be no exaggeration to describe them as the
   standard. The simulators enable us to predict reservoir performance,
   although this task becomes immensely difficult when dealing with complex
   reservoirs. The complexity can arise from variation in formation and
   fluid properties. The complexity of the reservoirs has always been
   handled with increasingly advanced approaches. This article presents
   some of the latest advancements in petroleum reservoir simulation. Also
   discussed is the framework of a futuristic reservoir simulator.
   It is predicted that in the near future, the coupling of 3-D imaging
   with comprehensive reservoir models will enable one to use drilling data
   as input information for the simulator creating a real-time reservoir
   monitoring system. The time is also not far off when a virtual reservoir
   will be a reality and will be able to undergo various modes of
   production schemes. The coupling of ultra-fast data acquisition system
   with digital/analog converters transforming signals into tangible
   sensations will make use of the capability of virtual reality
   incorporated into the state-of-the-art reservoir models. In their finest
   form, the reservoir simulators must be intelligent enough to integrate
   environmental impacts of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes into the
   technical and economical feasibility of different EORs. The economics,
   however, should respect both short-term and long-term impacts of oil
   production in order to claim ensure technical accuracy as well as
   rendering petroleum production schemes truly sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented reality is a growing field, with many diverse applications
   ranging from TV and film production, to industrial maintenance,
   medicine, education, entertainment and games. The central idea is to add
   virtual objects into a real scene, either by displaying them in a
   see-through head-mounted display, or by superimposing them on an image
   of the scene captured by a camera. Depending on the application, the
   added objects might be virtual characters in a TV or film production,
   instructions for repairing a car engine, or a reconstruction of an
   archaeological site. For the effect to be believable, the virtual
   objects must appear rigidly fixed to the real world, which requires the
   accurate measurement in real-time of the position of the camera or the
   user's head. Present technology cannot achieve this without resorting to
   systems that require a significant infrastructure in the operating
   environment, severely restricting the range of possible applications.}},

Abstract = {{A modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test ( TSST) was employed
   to determine whether exposure to a virtual audience using virtual
   reality (VR) technology would prompt an increase of neuroendocrine
   activity comparable to that prompted by a real audience. Following an
   anticipatory period, participants completed a speech or a
   speech-plus-math challenge in front of either a virtual audience, a
   panel of judges they were led to believe was behind a one-way mirror, or
   an audience comprised of confederates. An additional group that had
   prepared a speech was simply directed to observe the virtual audience
   but did not deliver the speech. Finally, a control group completed
   questionnaires for the duration of the experiment. Cortisol samples were
   obtained upon arrival to the laboratory, just before the challenge, and
   15 and 30 minutes after the task. Participants also completed a measure
   assessing stressor appraisals of the task before and after the
   challenge. Anticipation of the task was associated with a modest
   increase of cortisol levels, and a further rise of cortisol was evident
   in response to the challenge. The neuroendocrine changes evoked by the
   virtual audience were comparable to those elicited by the imagined
   audience ( behind the one-way mirror) but less than changes evoked by
   the panel of confederates. Stressor appraisals were higher
   post-challenge compared to those reported prior to the task; however,
   appraisals were similar across each group. These data suggest that VR
   technology may be amenable to evaluating the impact of psychosocial
   stressors such as the TSST.}},

Abstract = {{Within the last decade the media's full potential has been its use as a
   tool for conception and production of new architecture. What is this new
   architecture? Is it is really new or it is just a term to describe a
   transitory fashion development similar to the short lived post-modern
   flirtations of the 80th? A quick view at some of the buildings being
   constructed today does certainly suggest that there is a totally
   different approach to the production and the resultant form of
   architecture.
   Traditional methods of architecture conception are being replaced by
   digital media; a revolt, that many argue, has far-reaching inference in
   how the architectural entity is presented, recognized and practiced.
   More prominently, it proposes new formal possibilities absurd a decade
   ago. Architects working within this digital realm utilize CAD/Cam
   systems, CNC milling systems and software programs such as Maya, Form Z,
   and CATIA. Terms such as beauty, scale and proportion, used to describe
   the formal character of the pre-digital vernacular are being replaced by
   adjectives such as smooth, supple, and morphed, derived from the digital
   practice. The built result of such experiments are obvious the world
   over, whether it is Gehry's Philadelphia Music Hall, or Itto's new opera
   in Thailand, among others. The work of these architects was, a decade
   ago, confined to the virtual space of the computer, only seen in
   architectural magazines, viewed as a radical approach to architecture.
   However, the digital revolution has allowed for this vision to be
   transformed into reality. The use of digital tools both as a
   presentation tool and form generating device is unquestioned, a given,
   and will in the future consider any other traditional systems.
   Spaces have gone from being a physical to virtual of a gigantic digital
   network of networks, which shapes our collective future. The way and
   pace at which we connect, communicate, memorize, imagine and control the
   flows of valuable information have changed forever. The paper also will
   introduce a new concept of virtual urban spaces and interaction between
   it and the physical urban environments.}},

   We demonstrate first how simulations using virtual reality techniques
   help to narrow the area of uncertainty between two viewpoints: that of
   the work equipment ``designer{''}, who focuses on production constraints
   with respect to a prescribed task, and that of the end-user, who has to
   satisfy production constraints in relation to the resources at his
   disposal (personal, technical and organisational).
   We then introduce the method retained for validating these simulations.
   This focuses on the possibility of reproducing a reference activity
   through simulation. We distinguish two types of simulation validity:
   internal validity, which is based on the simulator's capacity to
   reproduce a task (a succession of simple operations), and external
   validity, which refers to the possibility of simulating activities
   comparable to those observed in real situations. The results presented
   concern mainly internal validity. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality ( VR), as a new technology, is integrated with software
   systems for engineering, design, and manufacturing. The integration has
   given a new impetus to the field of computer- aided engineering. This
   paper presents a research effort aimed at creating a virtual plastic
   injection molding ( VPIM) environment, which is designed and implemented
   based on techniques such as VR, multidiscipline simulation, and
   scientific visualization. The VPIM system includes two parts: designing
   in VPIM and evaluation in VPIM. It is the first system to scrutinize
   virtual prototype mock- ups of new products, machines and production
   processes in interactive graphic simulation. During the evaluating
   phase, coupled to appropriate computer- based reasoning and decision-
   support tools and driven by data from the real manufacturing
   environment, a realistic impression of the process of plastic injection
   molding and manufacture can be achieved and can be changed
   interactively, and it is possible to thoroughly examine the planned
   system and eventually detect and remove any defects and inadequacies.
   The construction approach and key techniques ( FEA, virtual assembly,
   stereoscopic display, a triangulated boundary-representation of an
   approximating polyhedron, collision detection, etc.) of the system are
   described in detail. The overall system is a powerful new approach for
   highly relevant industrial application of VPIM which focuses on the
   construction and assessment of alternate manufacturing sequences and
   mold design in an early design stage. Improvement of the design and
   manufacturing process will lead to better design and reduced development

Abstract = {{It is convenient to apply three-dimensional (3D) detecting instruments
   to automatic drive, virtual reality modeling, terrain reconnaissance,
   etc. It is presented that a new high-speed camera which achieves one
   three-dimensions image by only one light pulse in this paper. It has a
   measurement range of one kilometer and a distance resolution of five
   meters. This camera is composed with a pulse laser and three receivers
   which are made up with a Micro Channel Plate (MCP) and a Charge Coupled
   Device (CCD) each. These parts are mature commercial productions that
   provide low cost and high reliable to the 3D camera. As soon as the
   pulse laser emits a light pulse, the three receivers are modulated with
   synchronistical control circuits. A 3D picture can be calculated by
   three different density images which are obtained by that. The
   one-light-pulse-one-picture mode gives a flexible way to work with a
   gate signal. A 3D camera working with high-speed gate signal can achieve
   high-speed photography easily. A mathematic model is established to
   describe measurement range, distance detection precision and space
   resolving of the camera. The best modulation functions of the receivers
   are given with consideration of white noise by Euler-Lagrange equation.
   Due to the best modulation function we give a scheme is follows: The
   first receiver is modulated by a const gain, the second one is modulated
   by a linearly increasing gain and the last one is modulated by a linear
   decreasing gain. This combination achieve both low noise and simple
   structure. Because of the simple structure, several fibers which we
   named amending fibers can be used to amend error of receiver modulation
   and synchronistical error. Analysis of the detection precisions of the
   camera and continuous wave detection systems are carried out both in
   time domain and frequency domain. The results indicate pulse laser can
   increase the detection range by suppressing background light greatly and
   decreasing imaging time. But it achieves lower precision if the
   background light is faintness. Simulation experiment results are
   presented in this paper. A 1.4 kilometers fiber was used in this
   experiment to simulate a 700 meters distant, a Laser Diode (LD) is
   employed to simulate the pulse laser. A high voltage modulation circuit
   was designed to modulate the gain of MCP to implement the modulation
   function. The experiment results with and without amending fibers
   indicated that the primary noises come from CCD and the high voltage
   modulation circuit. The amending fibers can weaken the circuit errors in
   some degree. Future improvement is described in the end of the paper
   also.}},

Abstract = {{Under the legislative pressure and to deal with an economy of raw
   materials and energy used to transform this matter, designers have to
   consider more deeply the aspects related to the disassembly of the
   products for recycling, remanufacturing or reuse. Indeed, these
   ``recoveries{''} of product/components/materials will modify the
   production and recycling processes as well as the design choices. In
   particular, the disassembly operations have to be taken into account in
   the first stages of the product design, during the conceptual design
   phase, to obtain a good compromise concerning the final structure of the
   product. We will present in this article the principles for a future
   tool using virtual reality. This tool will be used during the conceptual
   phase of the design to assist the designer to jump from a functional
   model to the structure of the product by helping the definition of the
   components, of the connections and thus of the first structure of the
   product.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel approach to real-time spatial rendering of realistic
   auditory environments and sound sources recorded live, in the field.
   Using a set of standard microphones distributed throughout a real-world
   environment, we record the sound field simultaneously from several
   locations. After spatial calibration, we segment from this set of
   recordings a number of auditory components, together with their
   location. We compare existing time delay of arrival estimation
   techniques between pairs of widely spaced microphones and introduce a
   novel efficient hierarchical localization algorithm. Using the
   high-level representation thus obtained, we can edit and rerender the
   acquired auditory scene over a variety of listening setups. In
   particular, we can move or alter the different sound sources and
   arbitrarily choose the listening position. We can also composite
   elements of different scenes together in a spatially consistent way. Our
   approach provides efficient rendering of complex soundscapes which would
   be challenging to model using discrete point sources and traditional
   virtual acoustics techniques. We demonstrate a wide range of possible
   applications for games, virtual and augmented reality, and audio visual
   post production.}},

Abstract = {{In the modem, `disenchanted world', magic and mystery have by large been
   banned to the world of fiction: the realm of literature, film and, more
   recently, online computer games. From a modem perspective, fantasy
   fiction may instigate a `willing suspension of disbelief but it can
   never threaten the modem distinction between reality and fantasy, fact
   and fiction on which a `disenchanted world' is based. In this article it
   is questioned whether this analysis can be upheld by presenting a case
   study of online computer games. First, it is demonstrated that these
   `games' are based on the fantasy genre of J.J.R. Tolkien and have
   evolved from `interactive fiction' in the 1980s into the currents
   three-dimensional virtual worlds that defy the definition of fiction.
   The second section consists of a content-analysis of four popular online
   games (Ultima Online, Everquest, Dark Age of Camelot and World of
   Warcraft) to empirically explore the culture, social structure and
   economy of these online worlds and their potential meaning and appeal to
   the players. The analysis demonstrates that these virtual worlds break
   with modernity and its discontent as analyzed by sociologists such as
   Weber, Durkheim and Marx: they hark back to an `enchanted world'
   suffused with magic and mystery, reconstruct a stateless society with
   clans, guilds and `meaningful' communities and encourage players to
   regain control over the means of production. It is concluded that the
   emergence and popularity of online worlds are indicative for a
   problematic modem distinction between the real and fantasy, fact and
   fiction. Virtual worlds of fantasy may instigate `real' enchantments.}},

Abstract = {{Since ancient times, the human shape has been represented by means of
   different techniques of the fine arts. The more accurate
   three-dimensional (3D) static representations of the human shape have
   been created in metallic, stone and wax sculptures. However, these
   ``classical{''} techniques can not provide information about the human
   movement. In other hand, present virtual reality animation techniques
   provide 3D images with movement, but the results with human shape are
   still not so good.
   Many human movement expressions are nowadays considered as arts (best
   sport performances, for example) and they should be considered as part
   of our living heritage; so that, they should be recorded, classified and
   stored in order to preserve them. Nowadays, video is the most popular
   mean for recording the human movement. Biomechanics provides also quite
   complicated techniques to record human movement that are applied, for
   example, in digital-film productions.
   We applied laser scanning techniques that have been previously employed
   on monuments and topographic 3D representations in order to record the
   human body and motion.
   Our present work provides an experimental response to the human shape
   capture, which overcomes some limitations of traditional techniques.}},

Abstract = {{While discussing the current state of stereo head-mounted and 3D
   projection displays, the authors came to the realization that flat-panel
   LCD displays offer higher resolution than projection for stereo display
   at a low (and continually dropping) cost. More specifically, where
   head-mounted displays of moderate resolution and field-of-view cost tens
   of thousands of dollars, we can achieve an angular resolution
   approaching that of the human eye with a field-of-view (FOV) greater
   than 90 degrees for less than \$1500.
   For many immersive applications head tracking is unnecessary and
   sometimes even undesirable, and a low cost/high quality wide FOV display
   may significantly increase the application space for 3D display. After
   outlining the problem and potential of this solution we describe the
   initial construction of a simple Wheatstone stereoscope using 24{''} LCD
   displays and then show engineering improvements that increase the FOV
   and usability of the system.
   The applicability of a high-immersion, high-resolution display for art,
   entertainment, and simulation is presented along with a content
   production system that utilizes the capabilities of the system. We then
   discuss the potential use of the system for VR pain control therapy,

Abstract = {{Superplastic forming (SPF) is well known in aircraft production of
   Titanium and Aluminiurn parts. The process technology is commercially
   interesting for small quantities. The advantage of low upfront cost for
   the tooling is quickly lost however in conjunction with the longer cNcle
   times of forming under purest SPF conditions. At given production rates
   typical for the aircraft industry the technology has an economical
   advantage over conventional, ambient temperature sheet metal forming
   processes. Compared to established processes the break-even point is at
   about 400 to 4000 parts/year, depending on the metal alloy and the
   geometry. Transfer to high volume production as afforded by automotive
   production of niche products calls for a modified forming process and an
   optimisation of the production flow. One alternative for a modified
   process is called ``Hot Gas Pressure Forming{''} (HGPF). This process is
   very comparable to SPF, but the applied strain rates are much higher
   than recommended for SPF. FIGPF can be applied in combination with a
   pre-forming operation done by cold or hot forming. The production line
   which has to be created to establish a constant production flow of
   outerbody parts like doors, inner and outer, fenders, bonnet and
   trunklid, inner and outer and roof for a project with an annual
   production quantity of similar to 30 to 40 000 cars has been engineered
   on the basis of the material's forming behaviour studies, process
   investigations, cost analysis studies, etc. The elements of the
   production line like presses, interstockers, transportation, etc have
   been defined and placed with the help of a production simulation tool to
   get the best efficiency combined with suitable flexibility.}},

Pages = {{1527+}},

Abstract = {{It is widely recognised that organisations involved in coastal
   management must take steps to improve the ways in which stakeholders and
   the public are involved in coastal decision-making. In particular, there
   needs to be more emphasis on improving participation, consultation, and
   information provision throughout the process. In recognition of this,
   there is a need to develop new techniques that could aid the
   communication of coastal information to the public. It has been
   suggested that some of these techniques might involve the use of
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Whilst GIS are widely used by
   coastal managers, their application is hampered by the highly technical
   output that they often produce. However, the advent of a new type of
   system known as virtual reality GIS enables the likely effects of
   coastal management decisions to be presented in a format that is
   suitable for widespread consultation and dissemination. A proposed
   managed realignment scheme on the north Norfolk coast, England, is used
   to describe an integrated GIS methodology allowing the production of
   virtual reality representations of the current site environment and
   simulations of what might be present after the intervention. Both static
   and user-navigable visualisations have been produced because these lend
   themselves to both paper and electronic publication. Comparisons between
   the alternative methods are presented along with a discussion of the
   technical, user, and institutional issues surrounding the potential
   application of the methodology. It is argued that the techniques
   presented have the potential to stimulate meaningful discussion during
   the consultation process, although further research is still required to
   determine the exact form this might take.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual studios have long been used in commercial broadcasting. However,
   most virtual studios are based on ``blue screen{''} technology, and its
   two-dimensional (2-D) nature restricts the user from making natural
   three-dimensional (3-D) interactions. Actors have to follow prewritten
   scripts and pretend as if directly interacting with the synthetic
   objects. This often creates an unnatural and seemingly uncoordinated
   output. In this paper, we introduce an improved virtual-studio framework
   to enable actors/users to interact in 3-D more naturally with the
   synthetic environment and objects. The proposed system uses a stereo
   camera to first construct a 3-D environment (for the actor to act in), a
   multiview camera to extract the image and 3-D information about the
   actor, and a real-time registration and rendering software for
   generating the final output. Synthetic 3-D objects can be easily
   inserted and rendered, in real time, together with the 3-D environment
   and video actor for natural 3-D interaction. The enabling of natural 3-D
   interaction would make more cinematic techniques possible including live
   and spontaneous acting. The proposed system is not limited to broadcast
   production, but can also be used for creating virtual/augmented-reality
   environments for training and entertainment.}},

   identify and resolve problems when the implementation encountered major
   obstacles. While the implementation was a huge success, the devastating
   effect of a core problem being left unresolved is well documented. The

Abstract = {{The distinctive character of digital technology has created new

   Visualization has its own peculiarities as a separate object,
   notwithstanding the demands imposed by these new conditions. The
   medium's interactivity, the requirements of digital distribution, the
   necessary compromises and prerequisites, shape a special state of 3D
   modeling.
   This paper researches on the one hand the conditions for data
   collection, the state of data, its documentation and the production of
   the 3D model and on the other a theoretical framework of simulation and
   reproduction of the model of the ``city{''} based on reality. Man has
   never stopped creating works of art. The history of art testifies to

   made available for the production of an ultra-real model, we have
   managed to make the model of the city come alive.
   The conclusions result from the applications used employing popular
   software programs (AutoCAD, ArcVlEW (3D analyst), 3D Studio MAX). This
   experience led to the formulation of a 3D model creation framework which
   allows for a greater degree of realistic re-creation without coming into

Abstract = {{Many highly accurate computer tools have been developed for production

   a layout tool with which design engineers can construct assembly line
   models using 2- and 3-D views, and then employ design evaluation
   techniques for numerous important criteria such as volume flexibility,
   and visibility, using the layout data. Spatial evaluation and

Abstract = {{Users are increasingly recognizing the potential of virtual reality (VR)
   technology for applications such as data analysis, design review,
   product development, production planning, marketing, training, etc. The
   currently established workflow is to design and construct at a desktop
   system with CAD or modeling software, and visualize and evaluate the
   results at one or more VR centers equipped with CAVEs or Powerwalls.
   Discussions with users of VR installations have shown that there is a
   demand for smaller and more cost efficient VR installations. We have
   proposed the concept of a small VR system, PI-casso, based on user
   requirements, guidelines for office workplaces and some end-user tests
   which showed important limitations and the ergonomics problems of
   current VR installations. PI-casso is a compact, fully immersive VR
   system which complements the classic desktop workplace.
   In this paper we describe a set of user requirements and the results of
   the design in forming end-user tests, in addition to the concept and the
   technical specifications of the newly developed system. The first
   prototype of PI-casso was demonstrated at HCH 2003, where specialists
   from the human factors/ergonomics and the VR communities used our system
   and provided suggestions for improvement. This expert feedback was used
   to develop the improved versions described in this paper. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We will present an educational video games which propose the user to
   learn about his own voice attack production in order to teach him how to
   sing by imitation. The learning of singing, whether thought as the
   construction of the physical vocal pattern, or as the interpretative
   preparation of a piece of music, proceeds initially through observation,
   then by imitation of a given physical model. One of the principal
   difficulties in this mimetic process frequently lies in the different
   perceptions {[}1] of the singer and the listener. Without attempting to
   compensate directly this problem, we propose an interactive system that
   reacts to external data, thus facilitating the creation of a model of
   the singer and at the same time real-time simulation of his actions.
   We hence offer, within the given framework, to create a basic virtual
   animation, in order to recognize the voice attack. It is important at
   this stage to define the nature of the work envisaged, which will not
   consist of an exhaustive project. We specifically intend to describe the
   means for encoding the vocal attack expression and its relation to the
   facial and sound expression, in order to translate a feeling.
   We will then proceed to the development of a virtual, computer-generated
   lyric singer, using the process of interactive phonation as represented
   by a virtual actor with simplified expressions. Initially this phonation
   will be limited to the attack expression of a small number of phonemes.
   We will also predict the sound development based on this first attack.
   This part of the process could become the basis of further concrete
   developments and constitute the foundation for various potential
   extensions.}},

Abstract = {{Pervasive and on-demand computing are now a reality, mainly in the
   scientific area, and the computational Grid concept is gaining
   popularity as a scalable way to deliver access to a wide range of
   distributed computing and data resources. But, as Grids move from an
   experimental phase to real production and their deployment in the
   Internet significantly increases, controlling the security of a Grid
   application becomes imperative. The most significant Grid security issue
   is that the different sites composing the Grid will generally be managed
   by different organizations each with their own security mechanisms and
   policies. This makes any communication security arrangement on the
   entities participating to the Grid generally more difficult than if they
   were on the same local area network. In this paper, we show how the
   security and privacy services offered by scalable on-demand layer-2 MPLS
   VPN services can be applied in large-scale Grid scenarios and propose a
   novel network resource abstraction for discovery and setup of on-demand
   layer-2 Virtual Private Networks. It has been implemented in a Grid
   Information Service prototype which was successfully tested on a
   dedicated testbed infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Pepper's Ghost is a well known technique in theater productions that

   presented together with the static diorama. The usual pepper's ghost
   setup does not allow the presentation of the virtual objects in
   different z location. This, paper describes the development of a
   pepper's ghost AD system that is able to display the virtual objects in
   varying z locations. In this implementation, we used six layers of
   Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal (PDLC) as the projection screens. By
   adjusting the on/off status of the PDLC layer, we were able to present
   objects at different depths.}},

   structures, relevant models, including solid model, behavior model and
   control model, were established. Based on this, the constructing of VRMS
   was realized by Visual C++ and World Tool Kit (WTK). The application

Title = {{A simple cost-effective design for construction of a laparoscopic
   trainer}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Laparoscopic trainers have been shown to be
   effective tools for transitioning residents in surgical fields into live
   laparoscopic techniques. There have been few reports of homemade
   trainers, but each of these reports provides only scant detail about
   their construction, making production a novel task to those interested
   in employing this equipment. Virtual-reality trainers are gaining
   popularity and are exceptional modalities in the re-creation of
   laparoscopic surgery. In their present state, however, such trainers are
   very costly, making them unattainable by most urology residency
   programs. Numerous commercial non-virtual trainers are also available;
   however, these trainers are often cost-prohibitive or overly simplistic.
   Methods and Results: We describe a detailed design template for creation
   of a laparoscopic trainer based on modifications of previous designs.
   This trainer can be made easily at a cost of approximately US\$275.00
   and may be used in conjunction with existing laparoscopic equipment. The
   methods described herein can be followed by any local machinist to
   create this trainer.
   Conclusion: The relatively low total cost, ready material availability,
   and ease of construction make this trainer an appropriate option for the
   training of residents in laparoscopic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Today's highly competitive market places a great emphasis on improving
   efficiency and reducing costs. Simulation modelling is being widely used
   as a successful tool to design and analyze manufacturing systems.
   Enhancing the product design is an important issue. In addition,
   generating efficient simulation models with shorter lead times has
   become equally important to winning customer satisfaction. To meet these
   criteria, a new hybrid modelling approach for generating a simulation
   model and virtual environment from a process plan is presented.
   The proposed approach integrates simulation and virtual reality in order
   to render a dynamic shop floor model automatically using the basic
   process configurations. This is accomplished using an input database.
   The model interface is user-friendly so that the new users of simulation
   and administration can use the model easily once the input database
   requirement is fulfilled. Moreover, the model allows the user to trace
   the performance criteria of any process on the shop floor level at any
   instant as well as to experiment any production scenario. The virtual
   environment is used to verify through visualization the simulation model
   and also to provide a better understanding of the activities of the shop
   floor. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays companies operate in a difficult environment: the dynamics of
   innovations increase and product life cycles become shorter. Furthermore
   products and the corresponding manufacturing processes get more and more
   complex. Therefore, companies need new methods for the planning of
   manufacturing systems. One promising approach in this context is digital
   factory/virtual production-the modeling and analysis of computer models
   of the planned factory with the objective to reduce time and costs, For
   the modeling and analysis various simulation methods and programs have
   been developed. They are a highly valuable support for planning and
   visualizing the manufacturing system. But there is one major
   disadvantage: only experienced and long trained experts are able to
   operate with these programs. The graphical user interface is very
   complex and not intuitive to use. This results in an extensive and
   error-prone modeling of complex simulation models and a time-consuming
   interpretation of the simulation results.
   To overcome these weak points, intuitive and understandable man-machine
   interfaces like augmented and virtual reality can be used. This paper
   describes the architecture of a system which uses the technologies of
   augmented and virtual reality to support the planning process of complex
   manufacturing systems. The proposed system assists the user in modeling,
   the validation of the simulation model, and the subsequent optimization
   of the production system. A general application of the VR- and
   AR-technologies and of the simulation is realized by the development of
   appropriate linking and integration mechanisms. For the visualization of
   the arising 3D-data within the VR- and AR-environments. a dedicated
   3D-rendering library is used, (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An interactive 3-D sound processing system and its implementation is
   described, which is to provide virtual auditory environments to

   is implemented using a prevailing IBM-compatible PC and a single DSP.
   Since the organization of the proposed system is independent of

   tracks, the proposed system can be ported to various hardware entities.
   In addition, an easy-to-use user interface is also implemented on PC
   software for real-time input of 3-D sound movement. Owing to these

Abstract = {{3-D virtual reality (VR) visualization has opened new opportunities for
   complex 3D (x, y, z), 4D (x, y, z, t) or even nD data interpretation.
   The integration of common earth models (3D geologic data), mine models
   (3D excavations and stress), extraction models (1D time sequencing or
   mine sequencing) and nD monitoring data (e.g., seismic event parameters)
   into a common mining process model provides a platform for experts in
   various fields to better design, evaluate, monitor and modify mine plans
   throughout a mine's life; from feasibility, through operation, to
   closure. Viewing seismic data in a stereoscopic VR environment within a
   mining process model offers data interpretation processes previously
   unavailable at lower dimensionality. MIRARCO has developed data analysis
   and viewing processes specifically designed to enhance microseismic and
   seismic data interpretation in a collaborative, immersive VR
   environment; bringing mine personnel and expert consultants together to
   evaluate data and make strategic decisions for cost effective and safe
   mining.
   Seismic events and microseismicity cause hazards (rockbursts and rock
   mass degradation). The focus of this paper is on understanding
   seismicity from a mine planning and design point of view. Better
   understanding of the overall response of a mine to extraction also
   facilitates mine planning and design, assisting in reducing production
   costs and thus in enhancing safety and profitability.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, the execution of simulation projects in the field of
   production planning and logistics constitutes an integral part of the
   overall planning process, allowing for example the test of different
   system configurations and the choice of the most adequate model even
   before its implementation. The necessity of the manufacturing
   organisations to have internal systems that support their operations is
   bringing the definition of Digital Factory to reality. Today's available
   simulation software is based in static data input at start up, what can
   lead to the divergence of the real system and digital model results.
   Changes in the real system parameters are the major cause of that
   divergence, because the simulation stays with the initial set of values.
   This divergence does not allow a correct planning and results forecast,
   so it is necessary to create some kind of synchronisation between the
   digital model and the real system. Dynamic Data Driven Application
   Systems (DDDAS), a promising new concept that is starting to arise,
   consists in the ability of the simulation application to receive and
   respond online to physical data and measurements and/or control the
   measurements. This feedback keeps the digital model with the actualised
   real system parameters. In this work this concept is used to integrate
   data from a real production system into the digital model and to study
   the stability conditions of this feedback. A short discussion about the
   future benefits of using a dynamic data driven application system
   together with the concept of Grid Computing in an enterprise cooperative
   system will be also discussed. An assembly line where an automobile roof
   or sun-roof is attached to the car body is used as case Study. A virtual
   model of this system will be developed, using different tools (Petri
   Nets, State Flow, and object oriented simulation software) and the
   results will be compared. After the model's development, the study of
   the system performance using eM-Plant will be done and the system
   parameters optimised. The implementation of a real system feedback into

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modelling of turbulences in a microchannel
   suitable for fast calculations virtual reality visualizations in an
   interactive CAD tool. Most MEMS simulators show visualizations. which
   are static, while those showing dynamic visualizations, do so
   calculating with FEA whose slow data processing is Unsuitable for
   interactive CAD. Despite increasing computational power and speed, most
   simulators are still far away from real time dynamics or interactive
   rendering. Computations required for a visual simulation can take
   several hours, requiring two phases: (a) calculations, and (b)
   production of animated post-visualizations using the results Of the
   calculations. This paper describes the use of particle clusters and
   Lennart Jones particle modelling as an effective means of finding
   shortcuts for faster physically truthful visualizations. By
   approximating the particle clusters of gradually decreasing size. we
   were able to model the Sequence of movement of turbulences in a

Abstract = {{There has been a growing interest in the application of Collaborative
   Virtual Environments - CVEs in the WWW. However, most of the existing
   CVEs supporting systems are tuned to specific tasks and their
   architecture are, typically, tightly coupled to the applications. This
   makes any modification to the application dependent on programming,
   making CVEs construction and extension in large scale a challenging
   task. The ability to change an application without having to stop it is
   an importat non-functional requirement for CVEs, especially if they are
   to be provided as web services, available around the clock. This paper
   presents a novel solution for building and extending CVEs through the
   integration of interactive non-linear stories and Virtual Reality
   concepts. With this approach, CVEs applications can be composed as
   non-linear stories, which can be changed either completely or partly,
   making it easier for developers to build and/or extend CVEs
   applications. The innovative concept of this solution can make the
   development process of CVEs easier and faster, allowing their production
   in large scale. An art installation scenario is presented in this paper
   as a case study to illustrate how atomic simulations and VEML language
   can describe CVEs and extend them at runtime.}},

Abstract = {{In a coal-fired power plant, pulverized coal, using air as a transport
   medium, is pneumatically transported toward different burner nozzles by
   splitting the large pipe into small pipes through bifurcators or
   trifurcators. The combustion efficiency of the burner is dependent on
   matching the air and coal in these pipes. Increasingly tight emission
   standards also make the balance of air and coal a very critical factor
   for the success of the power plant. Coal roping occurs when the
   gas-solid flow passes through a curved pipe. The momentum of the
   particles carries them to the outside of the wall, concentrating in a
   small region. Therefore, the particle concentration in this small region
   is much higher than the other part of the pipe cross-section. Coal
   roping upstream of a coal distributor (bifurcator) can create a
   significant imbalance in coal loading in the split between the two
   branches. This can significantly impact plant performance and increase
   NOx production. Previous research {[}2] has shown that coal rope
   characteristics depend on many parameters; the geometry (i.e., elbow
   radius of curvature-to-pipe diameter ratio, pipe orientation, orifice
   opening, and the locations of orifices') of the coal pipe, which is
   determined at the design stage, will strongly affect the coal
   distribution in the outlet of coal pipes. This characteristic of coal
   roping indicates that optimizing the pipe geometry may be helpful in
   getting a more uniform coal distribution at the pipe's outlet
   cross-section and minimizing the problems caused by imbalance between
   burners. In this paper, we present the CFD-based coal pipeline design
   tool to achieve the evenly distributed coal particle distribution across
   the pipe cross-section.}},

   Methods: There were two main aspects of the project, one of design
   engineering and the other biomedical engineering, for the creation of
   ``artificial{''} and anatomical objects. The former were made with 3D
   Studio Max R4 by Autodesk, San Rafael, CA, while the latter were created
   starting from real bones scanned with a CT system or a surface scanner
   and elaborated with different programs (3D Studio Max R4, Scenebuilder
   by Viewpoint, New York, NY and Spinfire by Actify, San Francisco, CA).
   The 3D models were to be integrated into web modules and had to respect
   file limits while preserving a sufficient definition. Two systems of
   evaluation were used, a questionnaire on a selected sample and an
   external evaluation by a different university.
   Results: The Viewpoint format offers the best interactivity and size
   reduction (up to 96\% from the original 3D model). The created modules
   included production of radiological images, rapid prototyping, and
   anatomy. The complete ``3D Distant Learning Prototype{''} is available
   at www.webd.etsii.upm.es.
   Conclusions: The software currently available permits the construction
   of interactive modules. The verification on the selected sample and the
   evaluation by the University of Naples show that the structure is well
   organized and that the integration of the 3D models meets the
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Co-firing biomass with coal or gas in the existing units has gained
   increasing interest in the recent past to increase the production of
   environmentally friendly, renewable green power. This paper presents
   design considerations for co-firing biomass with natural gas in
   wall-fired burners by use of numerical modeling. The models currently
   used to predict solid fuel combustion rely on a spherical particle shape
   assumption, which may deviate a lot from reality for big biomass
   particles. A sphere gives a minimum in terms of the
   surface-area-to-volume ratio, which impacts significantly both motion
   and reaction of a particle. To better understand the biomass combustion
   and thus improve the design for co-firing biomass in wall-fired burners,
   non-sphericity of biomass particles is considered. To ease comparison,
   two cases are numerically studied in a 10 m long gas/biomass co-fired
   burner model. (1) The biomass particles are assumed as solid or hollow
   cylinders in shape, depending on the particle group. To model accurately
   the motion of biomass particles, the forces that could be important are
   all considered in the particle force balance, which includes a drag for
   non-spherical particles, an additional lift due to particle
   non-sphericity, and a ``virtual-mass{''} force due to relatively light
   biomass particles, as well as gravity and a pressure-gradient force.
   Since the drag and lift forces are both shape factor- and
   orientation-dependent, coupled particle rotation equations are resolved
   to update particle orientation. To better model the reaction of biomass
   particles, the actual particle surface area available and the average
   oxygen mass flux at particle surface are considered, both of which are
   shape factor-dependent. (2) The non-spherical biomass particles are
   simplified as equal-volume spheres, without any modification to the
   motion and reaction due to their non-sphericity. The simulation results
   show a big difference between the two cases and indicate it is very
   significant to take into account the non-sphericity of biomass particles
   in order to model biomass combustion more accurately. Methods to improve
   the design for co-firing biomass in wall-fired burners are finally
   suggested. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   would improve visualization of complex neurosurgical procedures.
   Methods. A robotic microscope and digital cameras were used to acquire
   left and right image pairs during cranial surgery, a and system
   facilitated image acquisition with the microscope. The surgeon
   determined a field of interest and a target or pivot point for image
   acquisition. Images were processed with commercially available software
   and hardware. Two-dimensional (2D) or interlaced left and right 2D
   images were reconstructed into a standard or stereoscopic QTVR format.
   Standard QTVR images were produced if stereoscopy was not needed.
   Intraoperative image sequences of regions of interest were captured in
   six patients. Relatively wide and deep dissections afford an opportunity
   for excellent QTVR production. Narrow or restricted surgical corridors
   can be reconstructed into the stereoscopic QTVR mode by using a keyhole
   mode of image acquisition. The stereoscopic effect is unimpressive with
   shallow or cortical Surface dissections, which can be reconstructed into
   standard QTVR images.
   Conclusions. The QTVR system depicts Multiple views of the same anatomy

   reconstructed images, the user can view a virtual three-dimensional tour

Abstract = {{Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, has initiated a research
   project investigating how virtual reality collaboration, virtual project
   rooms and online communication can be used in film making. In film
   production, creative, technical and financial demands are often large
   and complex. Usually there are also artistic ambitions involved in the
   film production. Often, the production has to be produced within a
   certain time frame and with a wide variety of different competences and
   specialists involved. This makes film production an interesting field to
   study when it comes to distance collaboration technology. Today, film
   production is a collaborative process spread out over different
   geographical locations. At the same time, digital technology is used
   more and more often in the production itself, e.g. digital video and
   digital post-production. The use of virtual project rooms and computer
   mediated communication such as e-mail, intranets and file transfer
   become established. The basic question is, how can all forms of computer
   mediated communication facilitate film productions, making the
   production more efficient and stream-lined? So far, two case studies
   where independent film is produced using collaboration over the Internet
   have been thoroughly investigated, and several in-depth interviews have
   been conducted at post-production studios around the world.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-production is meeting new challenges due to the continuing
   miniaturization of modern products and the increasing variety of
   emerging hybrid microsystems, which are mainly produced manually. For
   small lot production, teleoperated micro-assembly systems offer new
   perspectives in improving manual assembly processes. By using smart
   sensor information, teleoperated systems enable an operator to feel
   physically present in a distant environment. In contrast to conventional
   sensor applications, smart sensors are encapsulated and intelligent
   sensor modules with integrated functions for data processing, status
   monitoring and autonomous dynamic parameter adaptation. To investigate
   the correlation between smart sensor data and immersion, a teleoperated
   micro-assembly system has been developed {[}1]. To achieve a
   close-to-reality impression and to improve the dexterity of the
   operator, several smart sensor modules, including virtual sensors and
   shared sensor components, are integrated into the system. If required,
   sensor signals are enhanced and transformed into other modalities in
   order to control the micro-assembly system more intuitively. Due to
   flexibility requirements, all sensors are adaptable to new environments.
   Visual supervision is achieved through a precise optical system. All
   sensor components have been tested within an international teleoperation
   scenario consisting of a local operator in Munich, Germany, and a

Abstract = {{The properties of a product result at the end of the production chain.
   To predict these properties as accurate as feasible every process step
   has to be described in the exactest way possible. The big challenge for
   the simulation technique is to realistically depict the actual
   circumstances in the process chain as well as in the process depth.
   Usually, simulations are calculated for single process steps of an
   entire process chain. The aim of recent research is to combine these
   steps to a complete simulation of a plant even using the calculated
   results of the previous step as input data for the next one. An useful
   method to combine simulations and to present the results is the Virtual
   Reality tool. It offers the possibility to show a three dimensional
   model of the whole complex plant. Combined with results of logistic
   simulations the VR-model can visualize the whole production process. For
   the combination of calculations at several accuracy levels a
   hierarchical structure was developed. At selectable parts it is possible
   to go deeper into the process (vertical) and to integrate the above
   mentioned single process step calculations (horizontal). This horizontal
   and vertical enlargement of the simulation finally leads to an overall
   description of the production process of a product.
   The present manuscript at first describes the new medium Virtual Reality
   used for representation of complex production facilities in different
   visualization levels. The hierarchical model matrix with the interfaces
   is presented. Exemplified for the vertical refinement of the overall
   model the interaction workpiece/tool in rolling and the link of finite
   element method with physical material models is shown.}},

Abstract = {{Co-firing biomass with coal or gas in the existing units has gained
   increasing interest in the recent past to increase the production of
   environmentally friendly, renewable green power. In this paper,
   co-firing biomass with natural gas in a 10m long wall-fired burner model
   is studied numerically. To better understand biomass co-firing and
   therefore improve the design for co-firing biomass in wall-fired
   burners, the most commonly used spherical particle shape assumption is
   not used here, which may deviate a lot from reality for big biomass
   particles. A sphere gives a minimum in terms of the
   surface-area-to-volume ratio and thus experiences a totally different
   motion and reaction as a non-spherical particle. Therefore, an advanced
   non-spherical particle-tracking model is developed to calculate the
   motion and reaction of nonspherical biomass particles. The biomass
   particles are assumed as solid or hollow cylinders. In the particle
   force balance, the forces that could be important are all considered,
   which includes a drag proposed for non-spherical particles, an
   additional lift due to particle non-sphericity, and a ``virtual-mass{''}
   force due to relatively light biomass particles, as well as gravity and
   a pressure-gradient force. Since the drag and lift forces are both shape
   factor- and orientation-dependent, coupled particle rotation equations
   are resolved to update particle orientation. In the reaction of biomass
   particles, the actual particle surface area available and the average
   oxygen mass flux at particle surface are considered, both of which are
   shape factor-dependent.}},

   this key question boils down to the two alternatives video-see-through

   subjective user-acceptance a gaming environment was programmed that
   allowed good evaluation of hand-eye coordination, and that was inspired
   by the Star Wars movies. During an experimentation session with more
   than thirty participants a preference for optical-see-through glasses in
   conjunction with infra-red-tracking was found. Especially the
   high-computational demand for video-capture, processing and the

Abstract = {{The wide applications of CAD/CAM technologies have promoted the
   development and application of many advanced technologies, such as
   digital manufacturing, rapid prototyping, enterprise resources planning,
   computer integrated manufacturing, concurrent engineering, virtual
   reality, and mass customization. These advanced technologies all need to
   be supported by three-dimensional (3D) solid models of products. Most
   enterprises, however, still organize their production using 2D paper
   drawings, which makes difficulties for the application of these advanced
   technologies. It is needed to convert engineering paper drawings into 3D
   solid models for applications. Based on holo-extraction of information
   from paper drawings, this paper develops a systematic 3D reconstruction
   method, which simulates an experienced human designer's thinking mode in
   transforming inaccurate outlines with inaccurate projection
   relationships in 2D drawings into 3D image, with the aid of Genetic

   from the mere visualization of the CSP plant, information is integrated
   in a hierarchical structure which extends into the microstructural

   CSP plant but can be expanded as required, both in terms of depth
   (several levels) as well as along the production line (incorporating
   further process steps).

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) technology provides a human-computer interface that
   allows participants to interact naturally with digital objects which are
   represented as three-dimensional images that occupy positions in a
   three-dimensional world. Related to problems of engineering design and
   manufacturing, this new technology offers engineers the ability to work
   with computer models in a three-dimensional, immersive environment. This
   paper describes a virtual reality application where the results of a
   discrete event simulation of a manufacturing cell are integrated with a
   virtual model of the cell to produce a virtual environment. The program
   described in this paper the VRFactory, combines results from a
   commercial discrete event simulation program, SLAM II, with a virtual
   environment. This allows the user to investigate, using
   three-dimensional computer models, how various changes to the
   manufacturing cell affect part production. This investigation is
   performed while immersed in a computer-generated three-dimensional
   representation of the cell. Existing discrete event programming software
   allows only two-dimensional views of the factory as the parts progress
   through the simulation. Parts are shown only as primitive geometric
   shapes on the computer monitor and instantaneously move from one station
   to the next. The virtual environment implementation of the SLAM II
   results allows users to experience the simulation in a fully immersive
   three-dimensional digital environment. The virtual environment used here
   is a CAVE(TM)-like projection screen-based facility called the C2, which
   is located at Iowa State University. This paper describes the creation

Abstract = {{For manufacturers, profitability always depends upon the orderly and
   efficient development, production and distribution of their products.
   Product Data Management (PDM) is a unique technology, which integrates
   and manages all applications, information and processes that define a
   product, from design to manufacture, and to end-user support. The recent
   advance in Web-based technologies has the potential to greatly enhance
   PDM's functionality and capability, and to overcome the obstacles that
   many traditional PDM systems are confronted. It is found in this
   research that a multi-tiered, collaborative environment with advanced
   Web technologies is well suited for a PDM system to operate in. In this
   research, the overall architecture of a Web-enabled PDM system in the
   Collaborative Design environment is proposed. The architecture is based
   on the use of open data standards to allow users on a wide variety of
   platforms to access the product data and other related information. It
   enables product visualisation using interactive 3-D graphics by the
   disparate members of a collaborative PDM team. Integral elements of the
   proposed architecture include object-oriented database (OODB),
   object-oriented DataBase management system, common gateway interface
   script and visualisation applications. The use of standard for the
   exchange of product model data standard effectively integrates different
   CAD and PDM systems. The advantage of OODB is its efficiency and
   effectiveness in handling complex data structures often found in
   engineering applications. Virtual reality modelling language provides a
   3-D dynamic visualisation capability. The system, which is implemented
   using Microsoft Visual Basic, runs in the Windows environment with the

Abstract = {{Accuracy of space perception and distance estimation in virtual
   environments is an important precondition for the reliable use of
   virtual techniques in the design of products, workplaces, architecture,
   and production systems, The present study compares the accuracy of
   exocentric(1) distance estimations that a static perceiver achieves with
   two virtual presentation techniques: a desktop and an immersive cube
   presentation. Estimation accuracy in a physical mock-up is used as a
   point of reference. Subjects estimated exocentric distances in detailed
   models of a workplace previously unknown to them, All distances to be
   judged were located in the subjects' personal space (less than 1.5 m
   from the subject).
   Major differences between the two virtual presentation modes are that
   stereo information is available in the cube but not in desktop
   environment, and that, in the cube, changes in perspective are achieved
   by actually moving inside the cube instead of using a mouse.
   Furthermore, the cube provides a wider absolute field of view than the
   desk-top environment.
   The experiment showed advantages of the cube over desktop presentation
   when estimating exocentric distances in ``personal space{''} from a
   static position. The magnitude of distance estimation errors was
   significantly higher in the desk-top than in the cube environment.
   However, estimation errors tended to be overestimations in the cube
   presentation, whereas over- and underestimation occurred with equal
   frequency in the desk-top environment.
   In the discussion it is argued that the higher estimation accuracy in
   the cube environment may mainly be due to the availability of
   stereoscopic depth cues. According to Cutting (1997), these cues are
   especially relevant for spatial perception in ``personal space{''}.}},

   to reverse engineering and rapid prototyping of free-form shapes, as
   well as for applications to measurement and quality control. Suitable
   estimation of the measurement parameters, as well as specifically
   developed two-dimensional image analysis, allows us to retrieve very

   well as its portability. A kernel for elaboration of the views and for
   their alignment is provided. OPL-3D exhibits low-measurement uncertainty
   (120 mum) over large measurement areas (450 mmx340 mm), linearly

   environment by moving the image objects. The customized implant was
   prefabricated based on the 3-dimensional image created to cover the
   cranial defect. A skull model is also produced for real touch
   evaluation, surgical planning and rehearsal of surgical procedures. The
   results show that both of 3-dimensional medical image model and physical
   skull model were helpful for planning of craniofacial surgery and design
   of customized inplant. The surgery result was satisfactory without
   complication. Particular advantage was the unlimited trials in surgical
   simulation for using imaging model, and the close-to-reality surgical
   rehearsal for using physical model.}},

Abstract = {{Today's robot applications often include multi-robot multi-user
   environments which are planed thoroughly in 3D before installation. The
   key to gain the maximum benefit out of the already available models it
   is to reuse them for other purposes than only robot-simulation. One of
   these aspects surely is the training of future operators of the cell
   which is important especially for environments that are difficult to
   access for training. For example a production line in the automotive
   industry may not be shut down for a day of emergency-training.
   In this paper we will show how to reuse already modelled robot cells and
   mechanisms of the Cosimir simulations stem in emergency-training. We
   will present an approach for graphical visualisation and simulation of
   fire. We will show how to get realistic impressions of fire using
   advanced particle-simulation and how to use the advantages of particles
   to trigger states in a modified cellular automata used for the
   simulation of fire-behaviour. By this we can have a simulated fire
   developing and reacting on other fires and different substances as
   water, CO2 or oxygen. It turns out that the mechanisms implemented for
   fire-simulation are also valuable for robot-simulation. So there is a
   mutual benefit between the robot-simulation and the simulation of fire.
   The methods proposed in this paper have been implemented and
   successfully tested on Cosimir, a commercial robot-and
   VR-simulafion-system.}},

Title = {{Virtual prototyping of assembly components using process modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{16-27}},
Abstract = {{Assembly is a geometric problem, and assembly success depends on the
   quality of the mating parts. Practical considerations like deformation
   during manufacturing, wear and tear of machines and jigs, machine and
   tool chatter, and other constraints like cost and technical limitations
   contribute significantly to dimensional and form errors. Moreover, when
   the same component is subjected to more than one process during its
   fabrication, the final dimension and form of the part are influenced by
   each of the process variables. These factors are usually not accounted
   for during the design for assembly, as the data are not as yet
   available. This results in improper assembly and part rejection at a
   later stage. One approach of solving this problem is to develop a
   virtual prototype, which captures the real manufacturing variables by
   modeling the process impact on the assembled components. Virtual reality
   based manufacturing systems have been used in recent years for areas
   such as shape design and sensitivity analysis, virtual prototyping, and
   so on. The present work extends this concept by applying a finite
   element method based process modeling technique for assembly evaluation
   of a virtual prototype of a manufactured component.
   A Virtual Prototype Assembly Validation Environment (VPAVE) was
   developed to test this concept. A case study is presented to outline the
   use of process modeling for assembly evaluation of manufactured
   components. This approach can simulate unexpected difficulties that
   often arise during the actual assembly process due to the influence of
   production processes. The influence of a welding operation on a
   peg-in-hole assembly process is evaluated in detail to demonstrate the
   application of VPAVE.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical properties of biological tissue represent important
   diagnostic information and are of histological relevance (hard lesions,
   ``nodes{''} in organs: tumors; calcifications in vessels:
   arteriosclerosis). The problem is, that such information is usually
   obtained by digital palpation only, which is limited with respect to
   sensitivity. It requires intuitive assessment and does not allow
   quantitative documentation. A suitable sensor is required for
   quantitative detection of mechanical tissue properties. On the other
   hand, there is also some need for a realistic mechanical display of
   those tissue properties. Suitable actuator arrays with high spatial
   resolution and real-time capabilities are required operating in a haptic
   sensor actuator system with different applications. The sensor system
   uses real time ultrasonic elastography whereas the tactile actuator is
   based on electro-rheological fluids. Due to their small size the
   actuator array elements have to be manufactured by micro-mechanical
   production methods. In order to supply the actuator elements with
   individual high voltages a sophisticated switching and control concept
   have been designed. This haptic system has the potential of inducing
   real time substantial forces, using a compact lightweight mechanism
   which can be applied to numerous areas including intraoperative
   navigation, telemedicine, teaching, space and telecommunication.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling of flexible structures in MEMS, using
   splines for fast calculations suitable for virtual reality
   visualizations in a CAD tool. In almost all MEMS devices thin films with
   thickness of a few microns or less, are applied to structure the
   components that frequently serve in essential device functions. For
   movable components, the demands placed on thin films in these
   applications can sometimes subject them to various mechanical
   conditions, such as; fracture, plasticity, friction and wear, creep,
   fatigue, etc. Most MEMS simulators show visualizations, which are
   static, while those showing dynamic visualizations, do so with FEM whose
   slow data processing is unsuitable for interactive VR. Despite
   increasing computational power and speed, most simulators are still far
   away from real time dynamics or rendering. Computations required for a
   visual simulation can take several hours requiring two phases: (a)
   calculations; (b) production of animated post-visualizations using the
   results of the calculations. This paper describes the use of splines as
   an effective means of finding shortcuts for faster physically truthful
   visualizations. By approximating the deflection profile of a circular
   MEMS membrane with three splines, we were able to model the sequence of
   movement of the deflection shapes with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Modern 3D scanning technologies allow to reconstruct 3D digital
   representations of Cultural Heritage artifacts in a semi-automatic way,
   characterized by very high accuracy and wealth of details. The
   availability of an accurate digital representation opens several
   possibilities of utilization to experts (restorers, archivists, museum
   curators), or to ordinary people (students, museum visitors). 3D scanned
   data are commonly used for the production of animations, interactive
   visualizations, or virtual reality applications. A much more exciting
   opportunity is to use these data in the restoration of Cultural Heritage
   artworks. The integration between 3D graphic and restoration represents
   an open research field where many new supporting tools are required; the
   David restoration project has given several starting points and
   guidelines to the definition and development of innovative solutions.
   Digital 3D models can be used in two different but not subsidiary modes:
   as an instrument for the execution of specific investigations and as a
   supporting media for the archival and integration of all the
   restoration-related information, gathered with the different studies and
   analysis performed on the artwork.
   In this paper we present some recent work done in the framework of the
   Michelangelo's David restoration project. A 3D model of the David was
   reconstructed by the Digital Michelangelo Project, using laser-based 3D
   scanning technology. We have developed some tools to make those data
   accessible and useful in the restoration. Preliminary results are

Abstract = {{New communications technologies have opened up opportunities for
   collaborative relationships. There are needs to share information in
   order to remain current in the specialized technologies. Large complex
   projects as offshore projects require multiple expertise and
   Collaborative Immersive Visualization Environments (CIVE) provide
   mechanisms to share theses expertise and information. So, oil companies
   are now adopting CIVE as the new productive generation tools to analyze
   exploration and production data. There are several solutions at this
   marketplace. This paper brings a discussion about the critical technical
   factors that promote the immersion and affects directly in the cost of
   system. So, it is discussed several technological aspects of CIVE as
   projection technology, the application of nonconventional I/O devices,
   number of audience, and so on.}},

Abstract = {{The history of animation is generally referred to early production of
   traditional animation. It has begun in the early 1900. ``Animation is
   the essence of animation{''} as explained by Halas {[}1]. It is a series
   of images that appear to be in motion. It can be either traditional
   animation or computer animation. In addition Greenberg {[}2], explains
   ``Animation is a deliberately interpreted ``illusion of life.{''} It has
   been practiced for the last 70 years in both drawn and stop motion
   animation, and as such, is not an attempt to mimic human and animal life
   exactly.{''} Traditionally animation is produced by drawing illusion of
   movement created by photographing a series of individual drawings on
   successive frames on film. Gleicher {[}3], explains ``Animation is a
   uniquely expressive art form: it provides the creator with control over
   both the appearance and the movement of characters and objects. This
   gives artists tremendous freedom, which when well used, can create works
   with tremendous impact.{''}
   According to the historical timeline, many forms of animation have been
   introduced. This is including eel animation, clay animation, stop frame
   animation, three dimensional (3D) computer animation and virtual
   reality. With the rapid growth of this industry various types of
   techniques, methodologies and computer technologies have been developed,
   for instance keyframe animation, non-linear animation, motion capture,
   procedural animation and etc. This research will discuss about producing
   animation by using two methods; motion capture and keyframe animation.
   Throughout this, the author will cover some feedback from the
   respondents about the priority of using these both methods. It also will
   highlight the pros and cons of these two approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This contribution describes a studio system that supports the production
   of dynamic 3D content. The system is based on a multi-camera approach to
   capture dynamic scenes in a studio equipped with a chroma-keying
   facility. This paper focusses on the real-time functionality of the
   system. Three different methods for the computation of the visual hull
   from silhouette images were implemented and compared. Two methods use a
   volumetric representation (3D-array and octree representation). The
   third method uses a new line representation and has been shown to
   deliver more accurate surface approximations of objects.
   Further to the capture functionality, the system provides visualisation
   tools for planning the production and on-set visualisation. The latter
   includes a pre-view of the composed programme for the director and an
   immersive feedback for the actor. The immersive feedback is implemented
   using a view-dependent projection onto a special retro-reflective
   chroma-keying cloth and is not interfering with the shape capturing

Abstract = {{This paper relates to the problems of designing rich interaction, in the
   context of multi-player games, that would adequately support
   communication, control and co-ordination. The aspects of fun and rich
   experiences, usually required within the entertainment context, are
   easily overlooked in technologically driven system design. The concepts
   of a future ubiquitous game can be difficult to comprehend and evaluate
   in cases where a fully functioning physical prototype is not an option.
   One solution for the problem is Contextual Virtual Reality Prototyping
   that adds the missing context to the design simulations. The product can
   be designed and demonstrated in the corresponding environment, thus
   making it easier to understand the use-cases of, for example, a mobile
   device that has various location-dependent features. The main
   contribution of this research is the design and development approach
   that supports the creation of rich interaction. The primary emphasis of
   the approach is to avoid purely technologically driven design and
   development, but rather to provide a supporting, or even a guiding,
   approach that focuses on the creative process and conceptual
   understanding of rich interaction. This conceptually grounded content
   production-oriented approach to interactive system design is described
   and evaluated.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Social and psychological research on the Internet has been biased for a
   decade by the deterministic assumption that technology per se can have
   an `impact' on individuals, groups and organizations. This presumption
   is challenged by a different perspective, which conceives of technology
   as a social production and relies on `ethnographic' methodologies to
   investigate the specific ways in which social actors interact with
   technological tools. Adoption of new artifacts tends to disrupt existing
   task-artifact cycles and at the same time create new skills in social
   actors and new features in environments. For this reason new artifacts
   can enhance, rather than reduce, the ambiguity of everyday situations.
   The changes in the environment stimulated by the introduction of new
   artifacts may remain undetected for a while because social actors cannot
   rely on previous experiences to make sense of the new situation. The
   wide diffusion of the Internet can render more problematic the selection
   of information, its control by ordinary actors, interpersonal
   communication and self-presentation (which in cyberspace is exposed to
   special forms of deception), and the sense of presence in an
   environment. The ambiguity of the situations emerging on the Web can be
   reduced by awareness of the characteristics of cyberspace as an artifact
   under construction and by the development of shared cultural norms to
   regulate the exchanges taking place on the Web.}},

   Case Description. Three patients (NIL, LE, and DK), who were in the
   chronic phase following stroke, participated in a 2-week training
   ;program (31/2, hours a day) including dexterity tasks oil real objects
   and VR exercises. The VR simulations were targeted for range of motion,

   function was the most impaired at the beginning of the intervention, but
   showed improvement in the thumb and fingers in range of motion and speed
   of movement, LE improved in fractionation and range of motion of his
   thumb and fingers. DK made the greatest gains, showing improvement in
   range of motion and strength of the thumb, velocity of the thumb and
   fingers, and fractionation. Two of the 3 patients improved on the Jebsen

   Using Henri Lefebvre's notion that space is a social product, I suggest
   that both films contribute to an understanding of the production of
   social space in their exploration of the recent technological `advances'
   through which late capitalism has sought to extend its reign over space
   and of the role that virtual spaces have played within the `ideological
   fantasy' that constitutes our present social (spatial) reality. I
   conclude that these films ultimately reveal that while `advanced'

   processes - dream or reality?
   The long-term duration of forest production processes influences actions
   in forestry enterprises to a great extent and complicates the concrete
   time frame of specific goals and actions. According to this fact
   forestry tries to manage long-term production processes with the help of
   a specific forest planning. However, because of the long-term duration
   of forestry production processes you can find different opinions in the
   forestry discussion if target-oriented actions are possible or not.
   The aim of this research project is to analyse how long-term strategic
   goals are implemented into forestry action under specific forestry
   conditions such as long time horizons and complexity. The study
   participants are observed and their actions are analysed using a virtual
   computer-simulated stand modeled on real stand data. To visualize growth
   and exploitation a tree growth simulator is used. The state of the stand
   can be visualized using a three-dimentional graphic. With the help of
   this computer simulator the factor time can be controlled and minimized.
   The experiment offers the possibility of a timeless observation of
   forestry action for the entire duration of the stand.
   The results of the study show extrem differences of individual stand
   production processes and thereby question the possibility of
   target-oriented management of processes in forestry enterprises, It is
   supposed that the individual skills play a major role rather than the
   quality of operational goal formulation.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the current state of mathematics education is
   problematic in many countries. The Interactive Learning Environments
   group at CID (Centre for user-oriented IT Design) at the Royal Institute
   of Technology (KTH) has developed an avatar-based shared virtual
   environment called CyberMath, aimed at improving this situation by
   allowing interaction with mathematical content in new and exciting ways.
   CyberMath is suitable for exploring and teaching mathematics in
   situations where both the teacher and the students are co-present and
   physically separated. In this virtual reality environment the
   participants are represented by avatars. The space concept in virtual
   environments is different from that of any known physical space. Yet
   people seem to perceive, for example, chat rooms and bulletin board
   systems as places. Still, avatars have limited possibilities for
   non-verbal expressions, such as body language, which are important in
   order to improve the communication quality. To investigate the
   importance of human-to-human expression and eye-contact between actors
   in the CyberMath environment, a test lecture in mathematics was carried
   out between students at Uppsala University and a lecturer at the Royal
   Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. The Media Environment group
   at the KTH Learning Lab was responsible for the production of a sense of
   presence involving the lecturer and the students, using distance
   technology such as networked two-way television systems and interactive
   storytelling. Empirical material was collected from recordings of 5
   video sources and through a questionnaire given to the participants in
   the test. The main goal of the study was to investigate whether students
   at a distance could adapt to a combination of different shared virtual
   environments. It was found that presence production mediated as two-way
   television is a good way to build trust and to enhance non-verbal
   communication between the actors. The students treated the avatars on
   the computer screen and the lecturer on the display in front of them as
   real persons. In the same way, they treated the virtual reality space
   and the space distributed through two-way television as real spaces.}},

Abstract = {{In the past, the traditional training method of `hand to hand' teaching
   was adopted in industry. This method needs a long time and its
   efficiency is low, it is also affect the production and cannot keep up
   with the renewal of devices and equipments. Moreover may do harm to a
   practical system or devices and equipment. So it is necessary to have a
   new training method to carry out operation training. This is just the
   training simulator. In this paper, the introduction of training
   simulator about what is training simulator, why we use it, how it is
   done is presented. Moreover the container crane training simulator based
   on virtual reality and programmable logic control system (PLC) is
   introduced. In addition, the functions, working theory, composition and
   communication structure of the container crane training simulator are
   presented and some conclusions are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{PLC-programming for production plants is time and money consuming. It
   takes place in the critical period shortly before start of production
   which is a very time critical period. It should be started as early as
   possible, using concurrent engineering, interdisciplinary cooperation,
   efficient programming tools and simulation. Programming by demonstration
   using graspable models brings these techniques together and represents a
   crucial new approach. Graspable models of solid bricks are well suited
   for factory planning. Using these graspable models also for programming
   may improve cooperation and understanding of interdisciplinary experts.
   The Research Center artec features a new concept called Real Reality to
   synchronize real and virtual worlds dynamically. A magnetic tracking
   system serves as input device together with a data glove or a sensor
   ring. These devices provide input data that allow to keep track of the
   changes of the real world model. An automatic system for input
   abstraction generates PLC programs automatically from demonstrated
   behavior. The benefits of this concept are shorter time to production,
   lower costs, better control program validity and better cooperation in
   interdisciplinary teams. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.}},

   aesthetic design of free form curves and surfaces. It is a unique and
   comprehensive approach which uses task-specific configurations to

   3-D display for free hand sketching, surfacing and engineering

   physical prototype by additional shapes, textures and annotations. Both
   workspaces share a common interface and allow collaboration and

   the specific task. A faster design workflow and CAD data consistency can
   be thus naturally achieved. Tests and collaborations with designers,

Abstract = {{Non-flexible production structure can no longer survive on a turbulent
   market, since it can react to changes only with a major lag. In order to
   satisfy specific customer needs related to performance, quality,
   quantity, cost and delivery terms, it is necessary to restructure the
   existing factories, which are still organised according to the Taylor
   principle. One of the reconstruction possibilities is to implement new
   co-operation forms leading to virtual factories. For a virtual factory
   to be efficient, it needs to utilise modern communication-information
   technology. This paper presents and analyses the basic
   communication-information technologies that can be used to connect the
   participants within the virtual factory. The factory of the future will
   permanently develop. Its contours and structures will not be clearly
   recognised as those of the traditional factory, but will have the
   characteristics of virtual reality. New business relationships will be
   stronger and longer, just like the link with suppliers and customers.
   This requires a permanent, detailed restructuring and reorganisation of
   the enterprise's network and new sophisticated communication-information
   technologies. That is the future for many Croatian furniture
   manufacturing and wood products. If the idea is realised, the real
   virtual factory will influence the furniture market, as well as costs of

Abstract = {{Total efficiency of aerodynamic force production in insect flight
   depends on both the efficiency with which flight muscles turn metabolic
   energy into muscle mechanical power and the efficiency with which this
   power is converted into aerodynamic flight force by the flapping wings.
   Total efficiency has been estimated in tethered flying fruit flies
   Drosophila by modulating their power expenditures in a virtual reality
   flight simulator while simultaneously measuring stroke kinematics,
   locomotor performance and metabolic costs. During flight, muscle
   efficiency increases with increasing flight force production, whereas
   aerodynamic efficiency of lift production decreases with increasing
   forces. As a consequence of these opposite trends, total flight
   efficiency in Drosophila remains approximately constant within the
   kinematic working range of the flight motor. Total efficiency is broadly
   independent of different profile power estimates and typically amounts
   to 2-3\%. The animal achieves maximum total efficiency near hovering
   Right conditions, when the beating wings produce flight forces that are
   equal to the body weight of the insect. It remains uncertain whether
   this small advantage in total efficiency during hovering flight was
   shaped by evolutionary factors or results from functional constraints on
   both the production of mechanical power by the indirect flight muscles
   and the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms in flapping flight. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A researcher (Schwebke), in collaboration with her supervisor (Medway),
   investigated the production and reception of a corpus of documentary
   exchanges in which condominium owners voiced their opposition to
   renovations proposed by their board of directors. During the course of
   the research, which included textual analysis, interviews with owners
   and management, and readings with disinterested outside parties, the
   texts became radically unsettled, changing their meaning with each fresh
   stage of the process. The social reality that underlay and was referred
   to by the texts become equally indeterminate. Encounters with both texts
   and everyday readers were pervasively intertextualized; each new
   conversation was felt to be conducted in the presence of a growing
   collection of eavesdroppers. The two sets of outside readers-a group of
   ``ordinary folks{''} and an academic-became virtual participants in the
   ongoing construction of meaning, with academic and everyday perspectives
   merging in unusual combinations. The analysis draws on Bakhtinian and
   poststructuralist perspectives to elucidate this experience.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that virtual reality (VR) can be utilized for sales
   and marketing since it can enable the users to virtually and
   realistically experience the products they want to purchase. Further,
   there have some efforts to extend such VR systems by adding product
   configuration, analysis, and manufacturing/production information
   services. The limitations of these previous efforts were that they used
   expensive and proprietary VR tools, and they did not address the issue
   of integrating distributed and heterogeneous data sources. This paper
   proposes an information system architecture to overcome these
   limitations. The architecture is composed of a product configuration
   module (PCM) based on Java and Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML),
   and a product analysis module (PAM) based on Common Object Request
   Broker Architecture (CORBA). The PCM enables the users to virtually
   experience products from their own Web browsers on any computer
   platforms anywhere anytime. The PAM performs product analysis and
   provides decision-making information from distributed and heterogeneous
   data sources, for example, part information from vendors around the
   world. That is, the users can configure and virtually experience the
   products that they want to purchase on any client workstations such as
   PCs, Macintoshes, and Unix workstations. Further, they will be provided
   with the product analysis and manufacturing/ production information from
   various data sources including relational databases such as Oracle,
   Sybase, etc. A prototype system has been implemented to show the
   feasibility of the proposed architecture. The results of this paper can
   be used to greatly expand Web-based global marketing services,
   especially for virtual enterprises.
   Significance: The proposed information system architecture and the
   prototype are the first attempt to provide a generalized framework and
   implementation guidelines for integrating VR systems and various data
   sources to provide platform-independent product configuration, analysis,
   and manufacturing/production information. They can also contribute to
   extend current Web-based global marketing by allowing customers to
   virtually experience the products of interests on their own Web browsers
   via VRML.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have investigated how enhanced total flight force
   production compromises steering performance in tethered dying fruit
   flies, Drosophila melanogaster. The animals were flown in a closed-loop
   virtual-reality flight arena in which they modulated total flight force
   production in response to vertically oscillating visual patterns. By
   simultaneously measuring stroke amplitude and stroke frequency, we
   recorded the ability of each fly to modulate its wing kinematics at
   different levels of aerodynamic force production. At a flight force that
   exactly compensates body weight, the temporal deviations with which
   fruit flies vary their stroke amplitude and frequency are approximately
   2.7 degrees and 4.8 Hz of their mean value, respectively. This variance
   in wing kinematics decreases with increasing flight force production,
   and at maximum force production fruit flies are restricted to a unique
   combination of stroke amplitude, stroke frequency and mean force
   coefficient. This collapse in the kinematic envelope during peak force
   production could greatly attenuate the manoeuvrability and stability of
   animals in free flight.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in virtual reality (VR) and the increase in the power of
   modern computers has allowed for the rapid expansion of VR applications
   in industry. Virtual reality offers limitless possibilities in training,
   simulation and education. Although the minerals industry has been slow
   to invest in and use this advanced technology, the number of VR
   applications in the industry is increasing. VR has a great potential to
   increase productivity, better utilise time and most importantly improve
   safety awareness and therefore reduce incidents.
   The Advanced Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality in the Minerals
   Industry Research Unit (MineVR) at the University of Queensland, has
   recently been involved in developing VR applications for the minerals
   industry in conjunction with the various research centres. This paper
   describes the development of a VR training and simulation model of the
   CMTE's drill rig. The simulation will be used primarily in training
   operators, possible future developments include real-time production of
   results for given situations, and looking at linking the simulation to
   the actual drill in the laboratory. The simulation part of the model
   allows the user to turn the equipment on and off, operate it, and also
   identify some basic safety hazards that have been simulated around the

   between the domain expert and symbolic specification, and provide
   evidence of the correctness of the formalization process.

Pages = {{393-419}},
Abstract = {{Organizational systems are complex systems, which are very dependent on
   the continuous supportive efforts of trained people. At the same time
   the complexity of these systems transcends the capacity of individual
   engineers or groups of engineers. The construction and operation of
   medium to large organizational systems therefore requires the use of
   advanced computerized aids. The intensity and importance of human
   activity in these systems implies that the computerized aids must help
   to integrate human factors into the system structure as well as helping
   to design the more traditional aspects such as information flow,
   logistics, physical production, databases and the like.
   Simulation models are very powerful, broad and flexible tools to this
   end if applied systematically during the Lifetime of the organizational
   system. An intuitive description of process oriented discrete event
   simulation is given for readers unfamiliar with this form of simulation
   modelling. The paper then continues with a description of how models of
   organizational systems can be organized, wherein human factors find a
   natural place within the virtual actors that represent human beings.
   Human factors in an organization have a most central concept, which is
   the human ability to construct mental models. Through utilization of
   mental models of different aspects of reality, employees are able to
   predict and influence future sequences of events. This imparts a sense
   of understanding of the situation or problem at hand. Mental models,
   which are constructed on the basis of knowledge and experience, are
   considered insightful and lead to actions, which are seen as
   constructive, skilful and productive. These mental models are called
   cognitive models since they are the result of the individual's total
   psychological and physiological condition. Well-made cognitive models
   are a precondition for success in learning and using technical systems
   as well as a prerequisite for achieving good social relations. Briefly,
   well-trimmed cognitive models spell success at work and in private life.
   Simulation models of organizational systems can form the basis of
   advanced computerized aids used in the design and operation of
   organizational systems. They are able to integrate human factors with
   information processing and with transport and refinement of material all
   in the same dynamic model. Such simulation models are in harmony with
   the natural thought processes used by humans, especially when they are
   dealing with complex systems.}},

   component can be easily added and/or replaced, In this paper, a modular
   and object-oriented approach for the PC-based open robot control system
   is investigated. A standard reference model for controlling robots,
   which consists of a hardware platform, an operating system module, and
   various application software modules, is first proposed. Then, a
   PC-based open robot control (PC-ORC) system, which can reconfigure the
   control system in various production environments, is developed. The
   PC-ORC is constructed based upon the object-oriented method. Hence, it
   allows an easy implementation and modification of various modules. The
   PC-ORC consists of basic software, application objects, and additional
   hardware devices on a PC platform. Finally, by applying the proposed
   PC-ORC to a SCARA robot, the performance of the PC-ORC is examined.}},

   communicates with the producer through a small program, an applet, which

   settings necessary for producing the hologram, and then sends the 3D
   file together with its settings to a holographic printer for production
   of the hologram. The system uses virtual reality modeling language as an

Abstract = {{Television has traditionally been a passive medium from the viewer's
   perspective. The viewer sits in front of the television receiver and
   passively absorbs what is presented. On the other hand immersive virtual

   world, often as a participant rather than just as an observer. This
   paper looks at applying virtual reality display technology, the Address
   Recalculation Pipeline, to the familiar technology of television. In so
   doing it transforms the relationship between the viewers and the
   television program producers. It can be made compatible with
   conventional television for those without the means or inclination to
   buy the new technology and provides a base for future developments in
   virtual reality to be brought to the mass market. Linking virtual
   reality technology to mass entertainment has the potential to stimulate
   consumer interest and hence research and development finding in this
   demanding area, as well as providing an exciting, interactive system in
   its own right. The user interfaces of both the television production
   team and of the viewer are changed dramatically with this technology.
   This paper outlines how the user interfaces differ from conventional

Abstract = {{Recent changes in mushroom growing systems have made it necessary to
   re-examine airflow in the insulated polyethylene growing tunnels that
   are used in commercial production in Ireland. Even for the existing
   systems, improvements in the control of the air conditioning have made
   it more important that the correctly conditioned air be delivered to the
   cropping surface at the correct speed and as uniformly as possible
   throughout the cropping area. Air is delivered by means of a
   polyethylene distribution duct mounted at the roof of the tunnel.
   Typical delivery speeds are 4 to 7 ms(-1) and these have to be reduced
   to 10 to 30 cms(-1) at the cropping surface. New systems generally
   involve a change from single layer growing at the floor of the tunnel to
   the use of a variety of staging and shelving systems in both two and
   three layers. Largely because of the very low speeds involved and
   various disturbances such as heating and solar gain through the tunnel
   walls, it has proven difficult, using empirical methods, to
   characterise, and then to arrive at a solution for, all of the system
   options. In order, therefore, to gain insight into the system
   characteristics and to obtain guidance for future experimental work, the
   airflows were modelled using PHOENICS CFD software. The model was built
   up in stages with the Virtual Reality Interface module of the software,
   tuning the solver parameters and verifying that a physically realistic
   result was obtained in each case, until, finally, numerical convergence
   was obtained for the basic single layer growing system. A number of the
   alternative systems were then modelled and the main qualitative features
   of the flows were successfully reproduced. Broad agreement was found
   between the quantitative output from the models and the limited
   experimental data available to date.}},

Abstract = {{Non-flexible production structure can no longer survive on a turbulent
   market, since it can react to changes only with a major lag. In order to
   satisfy specific customer needs related to performance, quality,
   quantity, cost and terms, it is necessary to restructure the existing
   factories that are still organized according to Taylor principle. One of
   reconstruction possibilites is the implementation of new co-operation
   forms that lead to virtual factories. For a virtual factory to be
   efficient, it needs to utilize modern communication-information
   technology. This paper presents and analizes basic
   communication-information technologies that can be used to connect
   principants within the virtual factory. The factory of the future will
   permanently develop. Its contours and structures will not be clearly
   recognized as it would be those of traditional factory, but will have
   virtual reality characteristics. New business relationships will be even
   stronger and longer, just like connection with suppliers and customers.
   This requires permanent, detailed restructuring and reorganization for
   enterprises network and new-sophisticated communication-information

   a screen (3 x 2.3 m) an environmental array that moved according to the
   action produced by subjects on a treadmill. The task was to place either
   foot on a spatial target that appeared on the floor in front of the
   subject's displacement trajectory. We analyzed the step length patterns
   of subjects approaching these targets, along with the current
   target-subject relationship. The results are in agreement with a
   perception-action coupling type of control mechanism that operates
   continuously as the subject approaches the desired target. Apparently,

Abstract = {{Understanding how to use immersive virtual reality (VR) to support
   clinical practice presents a substantial challenge for the designers and
   users of this emerging technology. Taking this challenge, this article
   describes VR as a new medium: a communication medium in the case of
   multi-user VR and communication interface in the case of single-user VR.
   The core characteristics of VR as communication tool are (1) the
   perceptual illusion of nonmediation and (2) the sense of community. The
   first characteristic of a satisfying virtual environment is the
   disappearance of mediation, a level of experience where both the VR
   system and the physical environment disappear from the user's phenomenal
   awareness. The second characteristic is the sense of community that is
   developed by interaction. Through interaction that is made possible by
   multi-user VR, individuals find or form groups to share interests. So,
   information exchange becomes the carrier for expressing a self-concept
   and eliciting emotional support. Within this view, experiencing presence
   and telepresence depend less on the faithfulness of the reproduction of
   ``physical{''} aspects of ``external reality{''}-which is also a social
   production and not a primitive or ``natural{''} fact-and more on the
   capacity of simulation to produce a context in which social actors may
   communicate and cooperate. The consequences of this approach for the
   design and the development of clinically oriented VR systems are
   presented with the methodological and technical implications for the
   study of advanced human-computer interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the paper is to develop a virtual reality-supported
   rapid configuration and analysis system of a particular product, Unit
   BathRoom (UBR). The system is divided into the two modules, product
   configuration module (PCM) and product analysis module (PAM). The PCM,
   programmed using virtual reality software, enables the customers to
   replace, orient, and move the components necessary to configure the
   wanted products, and to visualize the results of engineering analysis of
   the configured product. The PAM analyzes the constructed UBR in terms of
   product cost, harmony, environmental constraints, delivery schedule,
   product safety, clearance, and reachability. The PAM's functionality is
   detailed using the IDEFO modeling methods, which can be effectively
   applied to other products. The two modules will be loosely coupled by
   way of a database management system. The PCM writes the constructed
   product data on the database and then the PAM reads and evaluates them
   and rewrites the analysis results on the database. The necessary data
   requirements are addressed using the IDEF1X data modeling method. The
   conceptual framework of the system designed through IDEFO and IDEF1X
   modeling can be easily applied to any product.
   Significance: The paper addresses the practical application of virtual
   reality technology to product configuration and analysis. The system
   enables the customers to quickly configure their preferred products and
   to visualize the engineering analysis results of design problems before
   production. Manufacturers can survive competitors using the developed
   system by both minimizing time-to-market and maximizing customer
   satisfactions.}},

Abstract = {{Global communication technologies need to go beyond intersubjective
   symbolic exchange toward supporting the engagement of people in their
   cultural context. Hence, what is needed is an understanding for the way
   in which the efficacy of cultural contexts manifests itself.
   Mass media have been successful in including people in a cycle of
   cultural production and consumption, but this process is accompanied by
   increased standardisation. The interindividual forms of communication,
   on the other hand, lend themselves to customisation but are too
   text-based to leverage the cultural context for purposes of creative
   collaboration.
   Virtual reality, we claim, by propagating a form of interaction based on
   immersion, could become the means of addressing and operating with
   cultural contexts. But then it needs to comprehend their ontological
   status in a new way.
   We place the efficacy of the cultural in the domain of the virtual. Our
   short paper gradually develops and refines a notion of virtuality that
   will stand up to the demands of grounding a development in that
   direction. In the process we draw on philosophy, cultural and media
   studies, and psychoanalysis.}},

Abstract = {{Vertigo and dizziness are very common symptoms caused by an impairment
   of the vestibular system that controls equilibrium. Human equilibrium is
   a complex sensory, cognitive and motor function based on the integration
   of multi-sensory cues and aimed at the production of complex motor
   behaviour. The latter can be considered as the result of three
   integrated components:
   exploration of the environment using visual information (scanning)
   maintenance of a desired body position against the force of gravity
   (stance)
   movement into the environment against the force of gravity (walking,
   running, jumping, ...)
   The role of the vestibular system is to integrate multisensorial cues
   and to provide a continuous representation ol. the body shape (segmental
   body orientation, e.g. perception of the reciprocal position of body
   segments) and of the orientation of the body into the environment
   (spatial orientation). The knowledge of both instantaneous body shape
   and body position into the environment are the basis for the production
   of a correct motor behaviour. Thus orientation, and especially spatial
   orientation, can be considered one of the most important aspects of the
   vestibular function that influence the navigation of the environment.
   In fact, the exploration or. a natural environment carl be conceived as
   essentially an oculo-motor affair in which the head and the body help
   overcoming the constraint of a narrow field of view. Our abilities to
   localise objects in space, orient relative to them, move toward or away
   from them, reach and manipulate them,;lll depend critically on
   receiving, processing and integrating spatial information from gravity
   the visual field, and our own body. The vestibular system provides the
   integration that serves to maintain a stable map between spatial
   localization, spatial orientation, and physical space. While
   vestibulo-oculomotor and vestibulo-spinal functions are usually
   investigated by means of electronystagmography and stabilometry,
   environmental exploration and navigation cannot be easily studied in the
   laboratory. We propose that virtual reality (VR) can provide a solution,
   particularly for the assessment of vestibular influence over spatial
   cognitive activities such as memory. We describe experiments carried out
   using virtual environments aimed to assess pre-planned motor behaviours.
   An equipment designed to specifically investigate navigation is also
   reported. We also propose a simple test to be performed in a real
   environment designed to assess and document spatial orientation and
   spatial memory.}},

   performance if they are integrated into a program early enough. Optical
   ATE (Automatic Test Equipment) is already zeroing distortion in HMDs and
   thereby making binocular displays a practical reality. A suitcase sized,
   field portable optical ATE unit could re-zero these errors in the Ready
   Room to cancel the effects of aging, minor damage and component
   replacement. Planning on this would yield large savings through relaxed
   component specifications and reduced logistic costs. Yet, the sustained
   performance would far exceed that attained with fixed calibration
   strategies. Major tactical benefits can come from reducing display
   errors, particularly in information fusion modes and virtual ``beyond

Abstract = {{Non-flexible production structure can no longer survive on a turbulent
   market, since it can react to changes only with a major lag. In order to
   satisfy specific customer needs related to performance, quality,

   factories that are still organized according to Taylor principle. One of
   the reconstruction possibilities is the implementation of new
   co-operation forms that lead to virtual factories. A virtual factory can
   only achieve efficiency by means of a modern communication-information
   technology. This paper presents and analyses basic
   communication-information technologies that can be used to connect
   participants within the virtual factory. The factory of the future will
   be permanently developing. Its contours and structures will not be
   clearly recognized, as those of a traditional factory would be, but it
   will have virtual reality characteristics. New business relationships
   will be even stronger and longer lasting just as well as the connections
   with suppliers and customers. This requires permanent, detailed
   restructuring and reorganization for enterprises network and new
   sophisticated communication-information technologies. That is the future
   of many Croatian furniture and wood products manufacturing. With such a

   QuickTime and streaming have the power to immerse students in a

   and abilities. Students can retrieve information whenever they need it,
   in a non-linear fashion, and at their own pace. When the streamed
   information is combined with other interactive technologies (such as

   outlines strategies of following objects, following people, and

Abstract = {{In applications of augmented reality like virtual studio TV production,
   multisite video conference applications using a virtual meeting room and
   synthetic/natural hybrid coding according to the new ISO/MPEG-4
   standard, a synthetic scene is mixed into a natural scene to generate a
   synthetic/natural hybrid image sequence. For realism, the illumination
   in both scenes should be identical. In this paper, the illumination of
   the natural scene is estimated automatically and applied to the
   synthetic scene. The natural scenes are restricted to scenes with
   nonoccluding, simple, moving, mainly rigid objects. For illumination
   estimation, these natural objects are automatically segmented in the
   natural image sequence and three-dimensionally (3-D) modeled using
   ellipsoid-like models. The 3-D shape, 3-D motion, and the displaced
   frame difference between two succeeding images are evaluated to estimate
   three illumination parameters. The parameters describe a distant point
   light source and ambient light. Using the estimated illumination
   parameters, the synthetic scene is rendered and mixed to the natural
   image sequence. Experimental results with a moving virtual object mixed
   into real video telephone sequences show that the virtual object appears
   naturally having the same shading and shadows as the real objects.
   Further, shading and shadow allows the viewer to understand the motion
   trajectory of the objects much better. Demos are available at

Abstract = {{The simulation and verification of NC codes for CNC machining is very

   if the codes are generated by conventional programming {[}1-4]. In fact,
   a succession of long and complex preliminary actions is needed to use
   this kind of machine tool, increasing the costs of the production
   process as a whole.
   The aim of this work is to provide the operator with a rapid and
   effective tool to visualize the result of a turning operation with the
   intent of saving time, human resources and money.
   In the paper a proper software, written in C language, is presented
   which through a polygon clipping algorithm and some OpenGL techniques,
   is able to simulate the machining using the numerical control
   verification module in a CN lathe.
   Since the rendering image of simulated results can closely mimic the
   machined part, this research provides a better approach for a very fast
   NC simulation and verification on an inexpensive personal computer. In
   addition the model can also be displayed from different viewpoints and
   it can be manipulated for further applications.
   This software can be used also as a visual postprocessor allowing the
   user to visualize the workpiece obtained from a part program produced

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) is usually described as a collection of
   technological hardware: a computer capable of 3D real-time animation, a
   head-mounted display, data gloves equipped with one or more position
   trackers. However, this focus on technology is disappointing for
   clinicians interested in developing virtual environments to be used in
   assessment and therapy. To overcome this limitation this chapter
   describes VR as an advanced communication tool: a communication medium
   in the case of multi-user VR and a communication interface in sigle-user
   VR.
   Two are the core characteristics of YR as communication tool: the
   perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the sense of community. The
   first characteristic of a satisfying virtual environment is the
   disappearance of mediation, a level of experience where both the VR
   system and the physical environment disappear from the user's phenomenal
   awareness. The second characteristic is the sense of community developed
   by interaction. Through interaction made possible by multi-user VR
   individuals find or form groups that share interests. So, information
   exchange becomes the carrier for expressing self-concept and eliciting
   emotional support Within this view, experiencing presence and
   telepresence does not depend so much on the faithfulness of the
   reproduction of `physical' aspects of `external reality' - which is also
   a social production, and not a primitive or `natural' fact - as on the
   capacity of simulation to produce a context in which social actors may
   communicate and cooperate.
   The consequences of this approach for the design and the development of
   clinical oriented VR systems are presented, together with the
   methodological and technical implications for the study of advanced
   human-computer interaction.}},

Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{Photogrammetry has many advantages as a technique for the acquisition of
   three-dimensional models for virtual reality. But the traditional
   photogrammetric process to extract 3D geometry from multiple images is
   often considered too labour-intensive. In this paper a method is
   presented with which a polyhedral object model can be efficiently
   derived from measurements in a single image combined with geometric
   knowledge on the object, Man-made objects can often be described by a
   polyhedral model and usually many geometric constraints are valid. These
   constraints are inferred during image interpretation or may even be
   extracted automatically. In this paper different types of geometric
   constraints and their use for object reconstruction are discussed.
   Applying more constraints than needed for reconstruction will lead to
   redundancy and thereby to the need for an adjustment. The redundancy is
   the basis for reliability that is introduced by testing for possible
   measurement errors. The adjusted observations are used for object
   reconstruction in a separate step. Of course the model that is obtained
   from a single image will not be complete, for instance due to occlusion.
   An arbitrary number of models can be combined using similarity
   transformations based on the coordinates of common points, The
   information gathered allows for a bundle adjustment if highest accuracy
   is strived for. In virtual reality applications this is generally not
   the case, as quality is mainly determined by visual perception, A visual
   aspect of major importance is the photo-realistic texture mapped to the
   facts of the object. This: texture is extracted from the same (single)
   image, Tn this paper the measurement process, the different types of
   constraints, their adjustment and the object model reconstruction are
   treated. A practical application of the proposed method is discussed in
   which a texture mapped model of a historic building is constructed and
   the repeatability of the method is assessed. The application shows the
   feasibility of the method and the potential of photogrammetry as an
   efficient tool for the production of 3D models for virtual reality
   applications. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of competing or contradictory orthodoxies in Nigerian
   forestry is a long recognised, if little explored research problem. Far
   from being the product of a monolithic culture, regional forestry, or,
   more inclusively agrosilvipastoral landscapes and fuelscapes, are social
   products which have been described as often construed in a plurality of
   ways and invested with diverse if not antithetical meanings by different
   individuals and social groups. They represent sites of contestation and
   cooperation for human agents and state agencies engaged in constructing,
   maintaining and modifying woodfuel and other forestry-related
   discourses. The author juxtaposes several such contests, their meanings,
   and the discourses of which they are a part. He does so with particular
   reference to perceived linkages between fuelwood use and production, on
   the one hand, and vegetation and degradation and other environmental
   change, on the other. The geographical focus is dryland Nigeria, in
   particular its regional forestry spaces and landscapes. In the
   conceptual framework empirical theorisation is combined with discourse
   and landscape analyses. The author concludes that the juxtaposition of
   forestry discourses, which he attempts, creates spaces for different
   landscape visions to be seen as virtual realities, which are shaped and
   sustained by social forces and (technologies of) representation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of the recovery of a realistic
   textured model of a scene from a sequence of images, without any prior
   knowledge either about the parameters of the cameras or about their
   motion. We do not require any knowledge of the absolute coordinates of
   some control points in the scene to achieve this goal, First, using
   various computer vision tools, we establish correspondences between the
   images and recover the epipolar geometry, from which we show how to
   compute the complete set of perspective projection matrices for all
   camera positions. Then, we proceed to reconstruct the geometry of the
   scene. We show how to rely on information of the scene such as parallel
   lines or known angles in order to reconstruct the geometry of the scene
   up to, respectively, an unknown affine transformation or an unknown
   similitude. Alternatively, if this information is not available, we can
   still recover the Euclidean structure of the scene through the
   techniques of self-calibration. The scene geometry is modeled as a set
   of polyhedra Textures to be mapped on the scene polygons are extracted
   automatically from the images. We show how several images can be
   combined through mosaicing in order to automatically remove visual
   artifacts such as pedestrians or trees from the textures.
   This vision system has been implemented as a vision server, which
   provides to a CAD-CAM modeler geometry or texture information extracted

Abstract = {{Industry needs software tool kit environments that integrate functions
   performed by engineers that are responsible for developing production
   systems. These tool kits would help engineers be more productive in the
   process of conceiving, designing, modeling, evaluating, and planning the
   implementation of manufacturing systems. Although individual tools are
   available to perform some of these functions, integrated tool kits are
   not. The lack of common information models and interface standards
   inhibits the development of interoperable software tools. The Production
   System Engineering (PSE) project at the National Institute of Standards
   and Technology (NIST) is working with U.S. industry, academia, and a
   number of international collaborators to address this problem.
   One set of interfaces that is required far tool kit integration is
   between virtual reality (VR) simulations and other manufacturing
   engineering applications. Virtual manufacturing technology allows
   engineers to construct a virtual model of the production system and
   evaluate its performance before the physical system is implemented The
   project team, working with the Black and Decker Corporation, selected a
   miter saw as a test case for production system engineering using virtual
   reality. The miter saw assembly line is an example of one real world
   production problem that has been used to identify requirements for
   engineering tool integration. NIST-developed VR simulations presented in
   this paper include a machine shop. an entire miter saw assembly line, a
   human assembly operations at a single workbench, and a turning center
   (lathe) with error modeling. This paper presents our progress in
   developing techniques, VR simulation models, and tool kit interfaces for

   Patients. These problem-based clinical cases allow the medical student
   to evaluate a patient at initial presentation, order diagnostic tests,
   observe the outcome and obtain context-sensitive feedback through a
   computer program designed at the Institute. Multimedia technology and

   Techniques that were previously restricted to specialized CAD/CAM tools

   photo-realistic facilities offered by QuicktimeVR and the model based
   renderings of VRML (Virtual Reality Mark-up Language) provide

   In January 1997, there were some 2,000 VRML models on the web. By
   January 1998, this number had grown to over 20,000. Research in
   human-computer interaction has, however, lagged behind these
   developments. Few guidelines can be applied to support the design of
   desktopVR. This paper, therefore, describes three criteria that can be
   applied to assess the usability of these interfaces. We then go on to
   validate these criteria against a number of case studies. Unfortunately,
   it is concluded that standard measures of task performance, successful

   how this influences cartographic design through the emotional drive of

   relies on modeling of the object structure using 3-D wire-frame models

   well suited to advanced applications such as generation and transmission
   of intermediate views for multiview receiver systems and applications in

Abstract = {{Modern integrated systems for the development and manufacturing of new
   products require cooperation between all services involved in this
   process. The design of new products to meet the market demands has to be
   performed according to its expected price through cooperation between
   the designer and the production engineer in order to achieve optimum
   part geometry according to available manufacturing technologies. To
   achieve optimum strength with minimum material use, the introduction of
   tailored blanks into the production process is recommended. Therefore,
   the concept and design of the product have to be prepared entirety in a
   virtual environment (CA-x), and this is made possible through powerful
   computer tools. The output of the virtual CA-x environment is a data
   file containing the geometrical and technological information about the
   new part. This file has to be transferred to the prototyping workshop or
   tooling plant.
   The prototyping workshop is supported by modern concepts and
   technologies of rapid prototyping and/or tooling. This enables the
   manufacturing of prototypes and zero-series in the shortest possible
   time. In the case of forming process optimization, tool reconstruction
   is possible through a layered tooling concept. Good cooperation between
   all the participants involved in the conceptual phase and development of
   a new product, gathering information and evaluation of possible failures
   in all development phases (FMEA) and their elimination before the
   test-series helps to shorter? development times. The cost minimization
   of possible product failures, which could appear in the production, is
   also significant.
   The paper presents a model of integral linkage of development,
   manufacturing and marketing, which differs from the systems known to
   date, particularly since it includes feed-back information loops. These
   serve for responding to rapid market changes and adapting the selection
   process for developmental and manufacturing technologies in order to

   research work has shown that all development phases are successfully
   linked Modern development concepts tend towards the further spreading of
   the global linkage of the development phases with manufacturing and
   current trade methods which are made possible through new communication

Abstract = {{The limits of flight performance have been estimated in tethered
   Drosophila melanogaster by modulating power requirements in a `virtual
   reality' flight arena. At peak capacity, the flight muscles can sustain
   a mechanical power output of nearly 80 W kg(-1) muscle mass at 24
   degrees C, which is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150\%
   of the animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that required
   to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity,
   brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in
   stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile
   or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic
   storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to
   aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at
   low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the
   induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of
   overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary
   requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster. By comparing the
   estimated mechanical power output with respirometrically measured total
   power input, we determined that muscle efficiency rises with increasing
   force production to a maximum of 10\%. This change in efficiency may
   reflect either increased crossbridge activation or a favorable strain
   regime during the production of peak forces.}},

   they efficiently tile complex surfaces with a specified number of
   polygons selected to optimize the trade-off between surface detail and
   real time display rates. Surface detail is preserved by extracting key
   shape features from the segmented objects which adaptively constrains
   the model tilers. To illustrate the utility of these models, we present
   an overview of their application in computed endoscopy and surgery

Abstract = {{We are developing an adjustment method of real-time computer graphics,

   producer, utilizing human sensibility technologically.
   Generally, production of real-time computer graphics needs much
   adjustment of various parameters, such as 3D object models/their
   motions/attributes/view angle/parallax etc., in order that the graphics
   gives audience superior effects as reality of materials, senses of
   experience and so on. And it is also known it costs much to adjust such
   various parameters by trial and error.
   A graphics producer often evaluates his graphics to improve it. For
   example, it may lack `'sense of speed'' or be necessary to be given more
   `'sense of settle down'', to improve it. On the other hand, we can know
   how the parameters in computer graphics affect such senses by means of
   statistically analyzing several samples of computer graphics which
   provide different senses. We paid attention to these two facts, so that
   we designed an adjustment method of the parameters by inputting phases
   of sense into a computer. By the way of using this method, it becomes
   possible to adjust real-time computer graphics more effectively than by
   conventional way of trial and error.}},

Abstract = {{The world wide demand for integrated CAD/CAM/CAE software solutions is
   growing rapidly. The computer professional services business which
   includes systems integrators is expected to grow to meet that demand
   because data exchange formats and interface protocols between
   CAD/CAM/CAE software applications are for the most part incompatible.
   This incompatibility results in increased business opportunities for
   professional integrators who create custom integration solutions to
   support data exchange between software applications. These solutions are
   expensive to implement, require a great deal of time to develop, are
   very inflexible, and are not based upon industry standards. These custom
   solutions result in numerous problems that can be broken down into three
   major technical impediments: 1) the lack of understanding of what
   information and knowledge is shared between manufacturing design,
   planning, and production areas, 2) the lack of information standards
   that define structure and content of data that must be shared by
   multiple manufacturing applications, and 3) the lack of standard
   interface protocols between support systems, e.g., communications and
   database management systems, that would facilitate the sharing of
   information between independently-developed software applications
   This paper presents perspectives on engineering tool integration issues.
   It also describes work underway to address those issues at NIST in
   Computer-Aided Manufacturing Engineering (CAME) and Systems Integration
   for Manufacturing Applications (SIMA) programs. Some of the technical
   activities include integration of design, process planning, plant
   layout, scheduling, and production simulation systems. A virtual
   production facility has been established using simulation and virtual
   reality systems that will provide a basis for validating manufacturing
   data before it is released to the shop fleer.}},

   particular, most processes of production are now automated in industrial
   fields. Owing to this computerization, even in fields of design which

   professional designers are forced to design new products in restricted

   prototype shapes of products with actual objects like clay. It is the
   best method to design a product full of originality. However, it is
   difficult to convert the actual model to CAD data using even the latest
   tools and CAD systems. Our team has developed Three-Dimensional Shape
   Modeler (3DSM). The 3DSM can generate the lost entities from measured
   data of an actual model. This system provides an interactive interface
   to generate the geometry of lines, planes and filet entities. Also, as
   this system is equipped with a stereoscopic display and a 3D mouse, it
   provides users with 3D environments. Thus, users can get a sense of the

Title = {{Modeling and simulation in enterprise integration - A framework and an

Abstract = {{This paper presents a framework and methodology that make systematic use
   of model definition, formalization, and analysis to enhance enterprise
   integration in engineering projects. Our definition of enterprise models
   is based on a philosophy for thinking about enterprise in terms of `'an
   Organization, carrying out a set of Processes to create one or more
   Products which satisfy predefined Objectives.'' This framework, which we
   have denoted the OPPO, illustrates our belief that enterprise models
   must give a complete and correct description of relevant aspects of
   reality in order to address their stated purpose. Based on the OPPO
   framework and an information processing view of project enterprise, we
   formalize our models using a methodology:or describing coordination
   requirements. This is based on a set of interaction matrices to develop
   so-called `'houses of complexity, uncertainty and interdependence'' that
   describe important dependencies between project requirements
   (objectives), deliverables (products), activities (process), and team
   members (organization). We use these dependencies as a basis for
   deriving measures of the coordination which must take place between
   various project participants during project execution. We can then use
   these coordination requirements as input to analysis, in the Virtual
   Design Team (VDT) object oriented discrete event simulation environment.
   The simulation results can be used for systematically assessing
   predicted effects of proposed changes. The framework, methodology, and
   analysis is illustrated by an example from engineering design of subsea
   modules for oil and gas production in offshore field development. The
   results from simulation give various performance measures, including
   critical path duration, work volume (a substitute for cost), and process
   performance in coordination (error handling and communication
   attendance).}},

Abstract = {{In the field of human animation; hair represents one of the most
   challenging problem and therefore has been one of the least satisfactory
   aspects of human images rendered to date. This paper proposes a method
   to generate realistic hair model for individuals based on image
   processing. The analysis and recognition of hair strands by image
   processing provides valuable data, particularly hair outline and the now
   direction of the hair for the rendering of realistic hair model for
   individuals. The image is binarised prior to lines extraction and the
   hair region is determined by a series of expansion and contraction.
   These data provide the basic guidance for the generation of the hair
   model. A simplified spring model is used for the hair modeling. In this
   spring system a strand of hair is modeled as a series of interconnected
   masses, springs and hinges. Hair strands are randomly generated on the
   skull. The outline region acquired through image processing ensures that
   the randomly generated bait strands fall neatly into the hair region.
   These strands are randomly rotated to shuffle the hair strands. In the
   case of hair strands falling out of the outline region, weights are
   added or reduced at the interconnected masses in order to move the
   strand back into the hair region. The lines extracted by image
   processing serves as guide-lines directing the hair strands to point in
   the desired direction. This realistic hair model can find many
   applications in the generation of synthetic humans and creatures in
   movies, multimedia and computer game productions.}},

Abstract = {{The next century will witness at least two great revolutions in the way
   goods are produced. First, workers will use the medium of virtual
   reality in all aspects of marketing, research, development, prototyping,
   manufacturing, sales and service. Second, market forces will drive
   manufacturing towards small-lot production and just-in-time delivery.
   Already, we can discern the merging of these megatrends into what some
   are calling agile manufacturing. Under this new paradigm, parts and
   processes will be designed and engineered within the mind of a computer,
   tooled and manufactured by the offspring of today's rapid prototyping
   equipment, and evaluated for performance and reliability by advanced
   nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques and sophisticated
   computational models. Computed tomography (CT) is the premier example of
   an NDE method suitable for future agile manufacturing activities. It is
   the only modality that provides convenient access to the full suite of
   engineering data that users will need to avail themselves of
   computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and
   computer-aided engineering (CAE) capabilities, as well as newly emerging

Abstract = {{It might be that the psychotic state with its multiple productions and
   the lack of being with which it alienates the subject, in the majority
   of cases only sets in secondarily, in the aftermath of a melancholic
   state, as silent as it is devastating. Thus the psychotic process would
   in fact `'cure'' being of the fracture of the ego caused by melancholic
   identification, as an extreme result of lack of being.
   The analytic procedure, in essence, completely contrasts with the
   pscyhotic process as defined above. Its role is to gather and unify
   under the primacy of speech and the ego, whereas psichosis divides and
   rejects. To analyse a patient is to substitue one process for the other.
   The melancholic origin of psychosis, however, makes it a difficult
   subject for analytic treatment.
   Freudian writings have taken into account this late discovery of
   analytic experience. The development of the concepts of projection and
   repression between the first and the second topics, bear witness to the
   virtual solution that Freud envisaged for the enigma of psychosis.}},

Title = {{Impact of information technology on the earth sciences}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{297-319}},
Abstract = {{The earth sciences went through a major paradigm shift in the 1960s with
   the understanding that the earth's crust is composed of many crustal
   plates which are moving relative to each other. This new basic insight
   quickly led to the solution of many longstanding geological and
   geophysical problems. The new paradigm allowed earth scientists to
   construct models that could explain a host of geological phenomena front
   the formation of mineral deposits and oil and gas accumulations to the
   controls of earthquakes and volcanism. Information technologies, mainly
   the rapidly increasing power of mainframe computers allowed the
   building, testing, and stimulation of these often complex models. Data
   gathering techniques also improved with the development of, for example,
   digital reflection seismology which provided much clearer images of the
   earth's crust, well-logging techniques, and remote sensing of the
   earth's surface by imaging technologies carried on satellites. Newly
   available or rapidly developing information technologies are about to
   propel the earth sciences, especially, the applied earth sciences, into
   a new era. The component information technologies are now available to
   allow the earth sciences to move to a dynamic systems view of the world.
   Currently, available, three-dimensional reflection seismology techniques
   have resulted in remarkably clear images of portions of the earth's
   crust. Applied to oil and gas exploration, this has resulted in improved
   pictures of the structure and form, or architecture, of oil and gas
   reservoirs. However, with currently available technology we have, at
   best, only a static picture of the reservoir. Based upon this,
   geologists and petroleum engineers must infer the dynamics of fluid flow
   through the reservoir. Newly emerging four-dimensional seismic
   reflection technology techniques allow repeated imaging of the reservoir
   and the detection of fluid fronts, from which inferences can be made
   about the rates and direction of flow and fluid pathways. This is
   analogous to time-lapse photography, but the cost of such techniques
   means that the interval between surveys is very long and the inferences
   yield only quasi-dynamic information. Similar problems exist in
   understanding the current state and the dynamics of important aquifers
   which supply water to urban populations and also to active earthquake
   belts. The capability to understand these and other dynamic systems
   within the earth is a major challenge to earth scientists and their
   colleagues in related disciplines. Indeed, the nature of the problems is
   such that the solutions will not be found by earth scientists alone.
   Multidisciplinary approaches are needed and the information technologies
   will enable the sharing of models and concepts between disciplines. The
   key components of the information technologies that will enable this
   revolution range from sensor technologies through data management and
   computation to visualization technologies. Each of these components
   needs to be linked to the other so that we have a complete feedback from
   observation through modeling to knowledge building and decision making.
   Sensor technologies, particularly the rapid advance of fibre optic
   sensors, will allow the continuous monitoring of many processes within
   the earth.
   Recent tests by Chevron have demonstrated that fibre optic sensors can
   be deployed within oil wells and that the data gathered yields useful
   information on the changes occurring within the reservoir. In this
   particular rest, the data gathered was temperature data from a reservoir
   through which steam is being driven to flush out viscous oil.
   The temperature data yielded information on the speed of heating through
   the reservoir and the pathways through which the heat was dispersed.
   From this type of data we can begin to understand the dynamic behavior
   of the reservoir. Coupled with the available static models, geologists
   and engineers can better predict the response of the reservoir to
   various production schemes. Data gathering, data storage and
   manipulation/interrogation technologies either exist or are being
   developed which will allow the scientist and engineer to avoid data
   overload and focus on extracting information of value from the data.
   Without these technologies, we are in danger of being overwhelmed by
   data to the extent that we miss its information content. This is
   probably the greatest danger of the so-called information age.
   Visualization technology is very important to the earth sciences, which
   by their nature require geologists and geophysicists to be able to
   picture complex three- and even four-dimensional pictures. Previously,
   the only way to share these complex pictures was through simple
   two-dimensional charts. Visualization technologies are now advancing
   rapidly and three-dimensional pictures can be developed, manipulated,
   and shared between the various disciplines and cultures which now staff
   the multidisciplinary teams which are necessary to solve the many
   complex problems we are faced with. The next stage in visualization of
   complex earth structures is some type of virtual reality. Experiments
   conducted by Chevron's research staff have shown that it is possible to
   project complex images on to a plane surface and with the aid of special
   glasses viewers can see, manipulate and discuss the inferences of a
   three-dimensional image. Simulation and model building technologies are
   already very advanced because this is an area which progressed rapidly
   with the increasing capability of maining-frame computers and
   workstations. However, critical advances in both simulation technologies
   and the computational capability and speed of workstation have taken the
   application of simulation and modeling technology into the bands of the
   generalist. This is a very important development because it allows
   models to be built and processes to be simulated that give new insights
   and lead to intelligent and knowledgeable applications. The role of the
   specialist will change in this new world of dispersed and readily
   available technology. Application of this entire suite of information
   technologies to the understanding of both natural and culturally-induced
   processes within the earth's crust is the final prize. The complete
   cycle from data gathering through modeling to knowledge building and
   improved decisions allows the application of systems and control theory
   to processes within the earth's crust. This dynamic loop will drive a
   major paradigm shift in the earth sciences and greatly increase the
   value of their application and integration with other technical
   disciplines. The speed with which the vision becomes reality will rely
   not only on the provision of appropriately robust technology at economic
   prices but also on the ability of earth scientists and those from
   companion disciplines to grasp this opportunity and persuade society of
   the many economic, ecologic and cultural benefits of such an approach.

Abstract = {{During recent years, the use of virtual reality technology has become
   widespread and popular. However, to further broaden the application of
   virtual reality, more sophisticated and realistic virtual worlds need to
   be developed. Traditionally, most virtual worlds are generated using
   three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics incorporating 3D geometric
   models and various rendering software. However, if 3D models become very
   complex, the delay time caused by rendering calculations makes it
   difficult for the user to be able to interact with the virtual world.
   Also, the production of realistic 3D computer graphics is very cost and
   labor intensive. From a very practical point of view, it is clear that
   we need some alternate approaches to realize a truly realistic virtual
   world. In this paper, the authors introduce an alternate method of
   generating virtual worlds other than 3D computer graphics. The method
   discussed here is to generate virtual worlds by processing 2D real
   images taken by video cameras. For this purpose, a special video camera
   system that can record image data indexed by position data was
   developed. Using recorded image data indexed by position data we are
   able to experience the virtual image world interactively. This method
   has become realistic due to advances in multimedia computers capable of
   handling large image data. A tested prototype of this kind of system is
   discussed in some depth, along with the capability and limitations of
   this prototype system.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{In 1989, ESA's Director General, Prof. R. Lust, instructed the Science
   Directorate to assess the interest for Europe in participating in an
   international Moon programme in case the world space agencies were to
   embark on such a visionary goal. A group of scientists was immediately
   convened to analyse in the first instance the scientific assets offered
   by a mission or a set of missions, to the Moon. They issued their report
   in 1992 and enthusiastically supported the initiative. The second phase
   of this exercise started in 1993 when the present ESA Director General
   instructed his associate Director for Strategy to analyse whether the
   Moon programme could be part of his proposition to the ESA Council which
   will meet at Ministerial level, in 1995. Several internal working groups
   were formed among which the FLOR (Future Lunar Objectives and
   Requirements working group) which was supposed to define the future
   objectives and requirements of the programme. The European approach The
   Moon Programme will follow a progressive phased approach tailored to the
   budget availabilities, in which the missions of the far future will
   benefit from the knowledge and experience gained during the initial
   phases, shaping the programme to the resources of the participating
   nations and to optimise its return. This philosophy of gradual progress
   and inter-related missions allows a transition from pure unmanned
   robotic activities towards a mixture of robotic and manned presence.
   The programme consists of four phases of interdependent missions as
   shown in Table 1. The first phase of lunar explorers/landers will make
   an inventory of the lunar surface features and resources by remote
   sensing or by means of small stations and revers.
   This would prepare the second phase of permanent robotic presence.
   During the third phase, robots would deploy scientific instruments and
   prepare the possibility, during the fourth phase, of a human outpost by
   setting up an oxygen production plant, as well as any other required
   facilities.
   The first phase of the European programme
   In order to prepare the first phase, ESA is presently undertaking the
   study of two projects: MORO (Moon Observatory Remote Orbiter) and LEDA
   (Lunar European Demonstration Approach). These two projects will draw on
   the experience of the U.S. Clementine mission. both in the areas of
   technologies and management techniques.
   International cooperation
   The Moon Programme should rest on the broadest international involvement
   of all nations. It should foster and benefit from international
   cooperation through the spreading of knowledge and the diffusion of
   technologies, leading to a rapid spread of innovative applications. Via
   the sophistication of telepresence and virtual reality, the Moon
   Programme offers the capability of `'involving'' everybody on Earth,
   whatever their technical level.
   To achieve the necessary political will, a worldwide initiative aimed at
   creating a consensus among the scientists, the politicians and the space
   organisations is necessary.

   Quinquennium (ILQ) built around a few simple scientific missions, as

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the miniaturization of display devices that are
   capable of displaying information from VGA and SVGA as well as video
   movies and TV images. We conclude that miniature CRTs are suitable
   display devices for mounting on helmets, headbands and spectacles. We
   then developed the 0.6in miniature CRT based on new concepts in the
   design of the electron gun and the phosphor screen. The miniature CRT
   developed has high resolution (800 x 600), high brightness (2000
   cd/m(2)), low power consumption (1.8 W for NTSC operation), is
   lightweight (6 g), and has low production cost. These 0.6in miniature
   CRTs can now be considered for new applications.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of large research production, such as universities, towns,
   cities or event countries, can be performed in several ways. These
   various approaches can range from the experts' feeling to a more precise
   analysis of co-authors' productivity. The various results obtained
   introduce the concept of `virtual research universes', where the global
   perception of the production hides the sharp reality of objectives and
   subjects. The ability to apply the various methodologies and tools to
   make such analysis can reduce misunderstanding and misleading positions,
   especially in funding, planning and project evaluation. This paper takes
   as an example the production of physics laboratories in Marseille (from
   the INSPEC database), and shows how the various levels of analysis can
   move from virtual to real research universes, thus helping the experts
   in their decision process.}},

Abstract = {{The profession of physical education must refocus on the centrality of

   professionals; (e) take control and responsibility for ethical action,

Abstract = {{A recent manifestation of the new paradigm regarding the relationship
   between humans and computers is called artificial reality, virtual
   reality or cyberspace.  Using 3D computer graphics, multisensory
   interactive interface devices and high resolution displays, a virtual
   world can be realized in which one can pick up imaginary objects as if
   they are real.  Using this technology, the virtual space decision
   support system (VSDSS) lets users design virtual products and experience
   them while in virtual space.  The VSDSS and its application to the
   unified sales/production system (US/PS) are described in this paper.  At
   present, most computer-aided manufacturing systems are geared towards
   production in small lots and are unable to handle custom-designed
   products.  Using the VSDSS, individuals will be able to design their own
   products.  The VSDSS system should be designed so that the dreams of the
   individuals can be realized.}},
