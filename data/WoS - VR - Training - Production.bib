Abstract = {{The growing elderly population and the increased incidence of mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) call for the
   improvement of the quality and the efficacy of the healthcare and social
   support services. Exercise and cognitive stimulation have been
   demonstrated to mitigate cognitive impairment and oxidative stress (OxS)
   has been recognized as a factor that contributes to the advancement of
   neurodegenerative diseases. Taking these aspects into account, the
   impact of a novel virtual reality (VR)-based program combining aerobic
   exercise and cognitive training has been evaluated in the pilot study
   proposed here. Ten patients (aged 73.3 +/- 5.7 years) with MCI
   (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE: 23.0 +/- 3.4) were randomly
   assigned to either 6 weeks physical and cognitive training (EXP) or
   control (CTR) group. Evaluations of cognitive profile, by a
   neuropsychological tests battery, and OxS, by collection of blood and
   urine samples, were performed before and at the end of the experimental
   period. The assessment of the patients' opinions toward the intervention
   was investigated through questionnaires. EXP group showed a tendency
   towards improvements in the MMSE, in visual-constructive test and
   visuo-spatial tests of attention, while CTR worsened. EXP group showed a
   greater improvement than CTR in the executive test, memory functions and
   verbal fluency. No statistical significance was obtained when comparing
   within and between both the groups, probably due to small number of
   subjects examined, which amplifies the effect of the slight
   heterogeneity in scores recorded. Despite a greater worsening of Daily
   Living Activities tests, all participants reported a better performance
   in real life, thanks to the elicited self-perceived improvement. After
   training intervention OxS (i.e., reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, oxidative damage of lipids and DNA) decreased resulting in
   significantly (range p < 0.05-0.001) lower in EXP vs. CTR group.
   Although not conclusive, the recorded effects in the present study are
   promising and suggest that this proposal would be a useful tool in
   support of cognitive training reducing OxS too. However, further studies
   on larger scale samples of patients are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The endovascular technique has led to a revolution in the care of
   patients with vascular disease; however, acquiring and maintaining
   proficiency over a broad spectrum of procedures is challenging.
   Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology allows the production of
   models that can be used for endovascular training. This article aims to
   explain the process and technologies available to produce vascular
   models for endovascular training, using 3D printing technology. The data
   are based on the group experience and a review of the literature.
   Different 3D printing methods are compared, describing their advantages,
   disadvantages and potential roles in surgical training. The process of
   3D printing a vascular model based on an imaging examination consists of
   the following steps: image acquisition, image post-processing, 3D
   printing and printed model post-processing. The entire process can take
   a week. Prospective studies have shown that 3D printing can improve
   surgical planning, especially in complex endovascular procedures, and
   allows the production of efficient simulators for endovascular training,
   improving residents' surgical performance and self-confidence.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Although two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional videos
   have traditionally provided foundations for reviewing operative
   procedures, the recent 360 degrees format may provide new dimensions to
   surgical education. This study sought to describe the production of a
   high quality 360 degrees video for an index-operation (augmented with
   educational material), while evaluating for variances in attentiveness,
   information retention, and appraisal compared to 2D.
   DESIGN: A 6-camera synchronised array (GoPro Omni, {[}California, United
   States]) was suspended inverted and recorded an elective laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy in 2016. A single-blinded randomised cross-over study
   was performed to evaluate this video in 360 degrees vs 2D formats. Group
   A experienced the 360 degrees video using Samsung (Suwon, South-Korea)
   GearVR virtual-reality headsets, followed by the 2D experience on a
   75-inch television. Group B were reversed. Each video was probed at
   designated time points for engagement levels and task-unrelated images
   or thoughts. Alternating question banks were administered following each
   video experience. Feedback was obtained via a short survey at study
   completion.
   SETTING: The New Academic and Education Building (NAEB) in Dublin, Royal
   College of Surgeons in Ireland, July 2017.
   PARTICIPANTS: Preclinical undergraduate students from a medical
   university in Ireland.
   RESULTS: Forty students participated with a mean age of 23.2 +/- 4.5
   years and equal sex involvement. The 360 degrees video demonstrated
   significantly higher engagement (p < 0.01) throughout the experience and
   lower task unrelated images or thoughts (p < 0.01). Significant
   variances in information retention between the 2 groups were absent (p =
   0.143) but most (65\%) reported the 360 degrees video as their learning
   platform of choice. Mean appraisal levels for the 360 degrees platform
   were positive with mean responses of > 8/10 for the platform for
   learning, immersion, and entertainment.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the successful development and
   evaluation of a 360 degrees operative video. This new video format
   demonstrated significant engagement and attentiveness benefits compared
   to traditional 2D formats. This requires further evaluation in the field
   of technology enhanced learning. (C) 2017 Association of Program

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: As the adoption of robotic procedures becomes more
   widespread, additional risk related to the learning curve can be
   expected. This article reports the results of a Delphi process to define
   procedures to optimize robotic training of thoracic surgeons and to
   promote safe performance of established robotic interventions as, for
   example, lung cancer and thymoma surgery.
   METHODS: In June 2016, a working panel was spontaneously created by
   members of the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) and European
   Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) with a specialist
   interest in robotic thoracic surgery and/or surgical training. An
   e-consensus-finding exercise using the Delphi methodology was applied
   requiring 80\% agreement to reach consensus on each question. Repeated
   iterations of anonymous voting continued over 3 rounds.
   RESULTS: Agreement was reached on many points: a standardized robotic
   training curriculum for robotic thoracic surgery should be divided into
   clearly defined sections as a staged learning pathway; the basic robotic
   curriculum should include a baseline evaluation, an e-learning module, a
   simulation-based training (including virtual reality simulation, Dry lab
   and Wet lab) and a robotic theatre (bedside) observation. Advanced
   robotic training should include e-learning on index procedures (right
   upper lobe) with video demonstration, access to video library of robotic
   procedures, simulation training, modular console training to index
   procedure, transition to full-procedure training with a proctor and
   final evaluation of the submitted video to certified independent
   examiners.
   CONCLUSIONS: Agreement was reached on a large number of questions to
   optimize and standardize training and education of thoracic surgeons in
   robotic activity. The production of the content of the learning material
   is ongoing.}},

Abstract = {{The main problem of the exploration and production sector in the oil and
   gas industry worldwide, and especially in Ecuador, lies in the extreme
   environmental conditions inherent to each oilfield, which makes it
   difficult to perform daily tasks of maintenance or equipment
   verification. Due to these harsh environments, this industry has seen
   the need to implement bilateral tele-operation systems with a high
   degree of scalability that allows the interaction between equipment and
   trained personnel that could safely perform maintenance activities. In
   order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to select a
   standardized messaging protocol that meets the current needs of the
   Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and allows the efficient use of
   communication channels bandwidth. This paper presents the design of a
   bilateral tele-operation system that allows the operator to carry out
   maintenance or remote inspection activities in the Well-Pads located in
   Petroamazonas EP, Ecuador. For the development of this system, the MQTT
   protocol is selected over other IIoT protocols because of its high speed
   of response in real time as well as its low consumption of resources. In
   the local site a virtual reality environment developed in a 3D graphic
   engine is implemented. Through input devices an infinite transparency is
   obtained, besides transmitting the experience and skills of the operator
   to the slave through the senses of sight, hearing, and kinesthesis. (C)

Journal = {{ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING AND DESIGN MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{46-59}},
Abstract = {{The architecture, engineering and construction industry has long dealt
   with problems such as schedule and budget overruns, quality and safety
   issues, and low productivity. Off-site construction, which is a hybrid
   of manufacturing and construction, has significant potential to address
   industry's endemic problems. However, off-site construction has been
   criticized for replicating the traditional subcontracting approach and
   therefore fragmented practice in the construction industry. The current
   research focuses on process integration and cross-training of
   multi-skilled resources as a solution to the aforementioned problem. To
   identify optimal process integration architectures for off-site
   construction, production data of three off-site manufacturers were
   analyzed by using a hybrid of fuzzy theory and the technique for order
   of preference by similarity to ideal solution. Findings reveal that
   process integration architectures transferring excess capacity from
   under-utilized to over-utilized resources in direct or indirect pathways
   are preferable in terms of satisfying decision criteria such as time and
   cost of cross-training, skill transferability, compliance with network
   logic, and safety considerations. The study contributes to the off-site
   construction literature by providing insight into dynamics of using
   multi-skilled resources. It also contributes to practice by developing a
   customizable and user-friendly framework for off-site production
   managers in order to identify the optimal process integration
   architecture in their own production scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Simulation is now firmly established in modern surgical
   training and is applicable not only to acquiring surgical skills but
   also to non-surgical skills and professionalism. A 5-day intensive
   Urology Simulation Boot Camp was run to teach emergency procedural
   skills, clinical reasoning, and communication skills using clinical
   scenario simulations, endoscopic and laparoscopic trainers. This paper
   reports the educational value of this first urology boot camp.
   Subjects and methods: Sixteen urology UK trainees completed pre-course
   questionnaires on their operative experience and confidence level in
   common urological procedures. The course included seven modules covering
   basic scrotal procedures, laparoscopic skills, ureteroscopy,
   transurethral resection of the prostate and bladder tumour, green light
   laser prostatectomy, familiarisation with common endoscopic equipment,
   bladder washout to remove clots, bladder botox injection, setting up
   urodynamics. Emergency urological conditions were managed using
   scenarios on SimMan (R). The main focus of the course was handson
   training using animal models, bench-top models and virtual reality
   simulators. Post-course assessment and feedback on the course structure
   and utility of knowledge gained together with a global outcome score was
   collected.
   Results: Overall all the sections of feedback received score of over
   4.5/5, with the hands-on training on simulators getting the best score
   4.8/5. When trainees were asked ``The training has equipped me with
   enhanced knowledge, understanding and skills,{''} the average score was
   4.9/5.0. The vast majority of participants felt they would recommend the
   boot camp to future junior trainees.
   Conclusion: This first UK Urology Simulation Boot Camp has demonstrated
   feasibility and effectiveness in enhancing trainee's experience. Given
   these positive feedbacks there is a good reason to expect that future
   courses will improve the overall skills of a new urology trainee. (C)

Abstract = {{Virtual reality (VR) training technology in the mining industry is a new
   field of research and utilization. The successful application of VR
   training system is critical to mine safety and production. Through the
   statistics of the current research and applications of VR training
   systems in mining industry, all the input/output devices are classified.
   Based on the classifications of the input/output devices that are used
   in the VR system, the current VR training systems for the mining
   industry could be divided into three types: screen-based general type,
   projector-based customized type, and head-mounted display (HMD)-based
   intuitive type. By employing a VR headset, a smartphone and a leap
   motion device, an HMD-based intuitive type VR training system prototype
   for drilling in underground mines has been developed. Ten trainees tried
   both the HMD-based intuitive system and the screen-based general control
   system to compare the experiences and training effects. The results show
   that the HMD-based system can give a much better user experience and is
   easy to use. Three of the five components of a VR training system,
   namely, the user, the tasks, and software and database should be given
   more attention in future research. With more available technologies of
   input and output devices, VR engines, and system software, the VR
   training system will eventually yield much better training results, and
   will play a more important role in as a training tool for mine safety.

Abstract = {{Medical devices play a crucial role in all diagnosis, care and treatment
   of patients and the number and variety of medical devices is huge and
   increasing annually. Healthcare professionals handle a wide range of
   devices every day. In this paper 3D Web-based interactive learning
   applications, which provide a helpful background, reminder and practical
   training to medical devices, have been developed. This article presents
   the production cycle of these interactive learning objects and the study
   conducted to measure the students' perception of the objects'
   effectiveness for learning. Three 3D Web-based interactive medical
   devices (sphygmomanometer, an electrocardiogram and a defibrillator) are
   described. Each of these applications introduces elements of
   interactivity with the learning content, and provides a practical
   training to the use of the medical devices. This e-learning package is
   aimed at all medical, nursing and allied healthcare professionals
   working in all healthcare settings and environments. It is also for all
   pharmacists in any environment and all community care workers in nursing
   and private healthcare settings. This training will also be useful to
   all staff working in a patient or patient supporting area, either
   someone new to the role or to a long standing professional as a reminder
   of best practice.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Internet technology, as a product of
   manufacturing technology and simulation technology, virtual assembly
   technology provides a good condition for the product assembly display.
   Although 3D printing has become more and more popular as a new printing
   technology, the assembly display of 3D printer is very scarce. In this
   study, the way to achieve the production of virtual assembly display
   platform for 3D printers is introduced to meet the needs of new product
   development, maintenance and operation training. Makerbot Replicator2 3D
   printer is used and the structure of 3D printer is modeled through the
   3D modeling software Solidworks. Afterward, the processes of mapping and
   animation are conducted in 3ds Max. Finally, the fabrication of the
   interactive display platform is completed in the import VRP. What is
   obtained is the virtual assembly platform which can realize the function
   of model display and assembly demonstration of 3D printer. The
   application of virtual reality technology to 3D printer can present the
   overall structure and function of 3D printer in a digital interactive
   mode so that it will no longer be restricted by environment and location
   conditions. Besides, it also provides a new way for the design,
   improvement, maintenance and management of industrial products, which is
   convenient to users to understand the internal and external structure
   and related functions of the 3D printer as quickly as possible.}},

   first rendered using photon mapping, and the CNN learns the
   correspondences between the depth images and caustic images. After
   learning, the CNN generates a caustic image from a depth image within 55
   milliseconds. In addition, the similarity between the generated caustic
   images and the ground truth shows that our method is very promising for
   the generation of caustic images for a number of known objects, though
   the method does not handle objects in which ground truth is not already
   known. This method can play an important role in scenes used for stage
   video production and interactive art in the future.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a global production strategy, many manufacturing companies
   locate their assembly plants in different countries around the world.
   While outsourcing final assembly closer to key markets has competitive
   benefits, these companies face new challenges with communication and
   dissemination of information. Concerning shop-floor operators
   specifically, these challenges affect the initial training and
   continuing improvement work instructions in particular. Emerging
   information and communication technology (ICT) have created new
   opportunities for supporting operators cognitively. In this paper, an
   immersive virtual reality (IVR) training environment for LEGO gearbox
   assembly was developed and tested. IVR technologies offer new
   opportunities where operators can access training and work instructions
   in an immersive environment, which could potentially improve and
   influence the operator performance and emotion. Both objective
   performance and subjective emotion were measured and the impacts were
   analyzed. The results were compared with four different operator support
   approaches and it was seen that IVR technology has the potential of
   improving operator and that further studies on integration, information,
   communication design and development of measurement methods are needed
   before the industry can benefit from the full potential of IVR
   technology. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{9-20}},
Abstract = {{The virtual has remained ``invisible{''} in Renaissance studies in
   spite, and probably because, of the developing virtual reality
   technologies and their most expedient potential in military training,
   games, and teledildonics. When it does attract scholarly attention, it
   is still in conjunction with negative connotations it has received in
   contemporary philosophy and culture, linking it to the unreal,
   simulacra, visual fake, copy or ``false approximation{''}. It is not
   surprising then that both in contemporary and Renaissance studies Satan
   appears to be the creator of the virtual. However, the virtual must not
   be confused with the visual or actualized forms that it effects. It is a
   powerful impulse that becomes perceptible in transductions of sensible
   things from one medium into another, like sound into architectural
   structures or visible forms. The Renaissance culture teems with such
   transduction. A very significant one occurs in the area of linguistics
   as language-already transduced from sound into writing-becomes
   virtualized for the second time by the printing press. What Bill Gates
   and others have done to virtualize the individual and community in our
   time, another Bill, William Caxton, did for England at the end of the
   fifteenth century. Mass production of books led to transductional
   activities of translation, reading, and interpretation, creating new
   virtual spaces and communities outside of the existing monopolies of
   knowledge. Within those virtual environments a new form of collective
   intelligence emerged which was not in the service of preserving
   knowledge as a fixed entity but subjected everything to an act of
   exploration. The prophet as initiator of virtual worlds was replaced by
   explorer. Accordingly, John Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost, as
   initiator and explorer of virtual worlds, ceases to be a fixed entity
   himself.}},

Abstract = {{In order to solve the problem that the training equipment is few and the
   training items are single, the students can not connect the learned
   skills with the actual production of the enterprise, a new idea is put
   forward to control the virtual 3D-model with the electronic components
   such as PLC, relay, switch and so on in Irai software. Through
   establishing contact between PLC and the model of tool controller
   mechanism for machining center based on Irai software, a platform is
   built for the experiments and training of mechatronics such as machine
   control, PLC and CNC machine tools installation and maintenance. The
   mechanical structure with large space, high cost and complicated
   structure can be virtual, and the electrical control part is real, thus
   solving the problems in the actual teaching and promoting the
   development of mechatronics teaching.
   Nowadays, virtual reality technology (referred to as VR) is gradually
   integrated into all aspects of our lives. VR is a kind of technology
   which provide immersion feeling in interactive three-dimensional
   environment that generates on the computer by using computer graphics
   system, various realities and interface devices. In the school teaching
   level, VR technology can solve the lack of experimental equipment and
   security risks in physical experimental equipment in teaching of various
   schools. For example, in the current PLC simulation training courses,
   students can only program on the PLC to achieve controlling motor
   rotation and LED lights{[}1]. Large, and complex mechanical structure
   can not be truly controlled.
   Engineering Training Center of Tianjin University of Technology and
   Education introduced a number of vertical machining centers, which had a
   good effect in training teaching. In order to make students having a
   more in-depth understanding of the NC system automation and make the
   further development of the mechatronics teaching, a new idea of real -
   time PLC control training for 3D virtual mechanical mechanism by using
   VR technology is presented. By generating solid modeling in Catia and
   other 3D drawing software and communicating with the external real PLC
   through the virtual control platform building by Irai, the real control
   on the virtual three-dimensional model will be realized. With the
   simulation system combined with virtual reality applying in the
   mechatronics training, the problems of laboratory teaching will be
   solved.}},

Abstract = {{The insufficiency in the number of skilled technicians becomes the main
   problem of many (not only industrial) companies in the Czech Republic
   and other EU countries. The seriousness of the situation is proved by
   the tendency to invest funds in the material equipment of schools,
   technical education and solutions that link theory with practice. It is
   necessary to realize that the future professionals are being prepared
   for the positions in fast-changing area of industry. The change is
   enhanced by the rapid evolution of technologies, i.e. the so-called
   Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). This concept was officially
   introduced at the 2013 Hannover Fair. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
   is a term describing cyber - physical systems, which bring radical
   changes in the production process.
   The overall development in the EU countries in recent years has shown
   that the working competences in many professions vary in comparison with
   the past. Current trends in the development of technologies tend to
   downsize or revise certain working specializations. Certain new
   specializations have been created in some areas with growing demand for
   skilled professionals, mainly in connection with IT systems. An example
   might be the development in car-repairs, where the competencies in
   electronics are becoming essential, especially with respect to the
   electro-mobility.
   This development leads to the corresponding changes in the system of
   technical vocational education at the national and international level.
   This article describes the main areas of impact of the innovation
   process on technical vocational education. The main sub-themes addressed
   are the following:
   Analysis of the competencies and skills of workers and technicians in
   smart factories.
   Induced changes in curriculum, introducing of new courses in vocational
   training.
   Induced changes in training of teachers of vocational subjects.
   Impact of robotics, automation and 3D technologies on technical
   training.
   Internet, virtual and augmented reality.
   The paper brings some results of the research that was focused on the
   readiness of the Czech vocational subject teachers for the upcoming the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an acoustic-VR system that converts acoustic signals of human
   language (Chinese) to realistic 3D tongue animation sequences in real
   time. It is known that directly capturing the 3D geometry of the tongue
   at a frame rate that matches the tongue's swift movement during the
   language production is challenging. This difficulty is handled by
   utilizing the electromagnetic articulography (EMA) sensor as the
   intermediate medium linking the acoustic data to the simulated virtual
   reality. We leverage Deep Neural Networks to train a model that maps the
   input acoustic signals to the positional information of pre-defined EMA
   sensors based on 1,108 utterances. Afterwards, we develop a novel
   reduced physics-based dynamics model for simulating the tongue's motion.
   Unlike the existing methods, our deformable model is nonlinear,
   volume-preserving, and accommodates collision between the tongue and the
   oral cavity (mostly with the jaw). The tongue's deformation could be
   highly localized which imposes extra difficulties for existing spectral
   model reduction methods. Alternatively, we adopt a spatial reduction
   method that allows an expressive subspace representation of the tongue's
   deformation. We systematically evaluate the simulated tongue shapes with
   real-world shapes acquired by MRI/CT. Our experiment demonstrates that
   the proposed system is able to deliver a realistic visual tongue
   animation corresponding to a user's speech signal.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Existing research suggests that digital games can be used
   effectively for educational purposes at any level of training.
   Perioperative nursing educators can use games to complement curricula,
   in guidance and staff development programs, to foster team
   collaboration, and to give support to critical thinking in nursing
   practice because it is a complex environment.
   Objective: To describe the process of developing an educational game to
   set up surgical instruments on the Mayo stand or back table as a
   resource to assist the instructor in surgical instrumentation training
   for students and nursing health professionals in continued education.
   Methods: The study was characterized by applied research in production
   technology. It included the phases of analysis and design, development,
   and evaluation. The objectives of the educational game were developed
   through Bloom's taxonomy. Parallel to the physical development of the
   educational game, a proposed model for the use of digital elements in
   educational game activities was applied to develop the game content.
   Results: The development of the game called ``Playing with Tweezers{''}
   was carried out in 3 phases and was evaluated by 15 participants,
   comprising students and professional experts in various areas of
   knowledge such as nursing, information technology, and education. An
   environment was created with an initial screen, menu buttons containing
   the rules of the game, and virtual tour modes for learning and
   assessment.
   Conclusions: The ``digital{''} nursing student needs engagement,
   stimulation, reality, and entertainment, not just readings. ``Playing
   with Tweezers{''} is an example of educational gaming as an innovative
   teaching strategy in nursing that encourages the strategy of involving
   the use of educational games to support theoretical or practical
   classroom teaching. Thus, the teacher does not work with only 1 type of
   teaching methodology, but with a combination of different methodologies.
   In addition, we cannot forget that skill training in an educational game
   does not replace curricular practice, but helps.}},

   paper proposes a mathematical model for the response analysis of
   multi-body system. The solution of the mathematical model for virtual
   simulation is also presented. The architecture of VR simulation system
   and the crane simulator are designed. A case study was performed to
   validate the feasibility of the proposed model. The results show the VR

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a concept capability demonstration
   pilot study, the aim of which was to investigate how inexpensive gaming
   software and hardware technologies could be exploited in the development
   and evaluation of a simulator prototype for training Royal Navy mine
   clearance divers, specifically focusing on the detection and accurate
   reporting of the location and condition of underwater ordnance. The
   simulator was constructed using the Blender open source 3D modelling
   toolkit and game engine, and featured not only an interactive 3D editor
   for underwater scenario generation by instructors, but also a real-time,
   3D After Action Review (AAR) system for formative assessment and
   feedback. The simulated scenarios and AAR architecture were based on
   early human factors observations and briefings conducted at the UK's
   Defence Diving School (DDS), an organisation that provides basic
   military diving training for all Royal Navy and Army (Royal Engineers)
   divers. An experimental pilot study was undertaken to determine whether
   or not basic navigational and mine detection components of diver
   performance could be improved as a result of exposing participants to
   the AAR system, delivered between simulated diving scenarios. The
   results suggest that the provision of AAR was accompanied by significant
   performance improvements in the positive identification of simulated
   underwater ordnance (in contrast to non-ordnance objects) and on
   participants' description of their location, their immediate in-water or
   seabed context and their structural condition. Only marginal
   improvements were found with participants' navigational performance in
   terms of their deviation accuracies from a pre-programmed expert search
   path. Overall, this project contributes to the growing corpus of
   evidence supporting the development of simulators that demonstrate the
   value of exploiting open source gaming software and the significance of
   adopting established games design techniques in delivering highly
   engaging scenarios to defence training communities. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Virtual laboratories (VL) and interactive simulations are excellent
   approaches for training students to understand technical principles.
   This can be useful in many fields of science and engineering teaching.
   For this purpose, we have developed a virtual environment that can
   simulate real-laboratory operations, effectively enhancing the teaching
   process with an intuitive and appealing interface. Such software shows
   the virtual-studio practice characterization of basic
   biofuel-properties, simulating reality step-by-step. This virtual
   laboratory has been used by students of the postgraduate master subject
   on Biomass for Power Generation, belonging to the Master of Distributed
   Renewable Energy. The aim of this tool is to help students to study,
   learn and investigate on their own. The virtual lab is made of a
   web-based application to complement experimental laboratory training,
   allowing students to prepare their experimental practices before going
   to the lab, and to review them at any time afterwards. The computer
   application exhibits key virtual-lab educational features, like an
   integrative layout and self-evaluating tests. It allows a personalized
   and active learning-process, adaptability to teacher's aims and
   versatility and simplicity, using different multimedia resources. A
   satisfaction questionnaire was carried out between master degree
   students to evaluate the usefulness of the VL Such a tool was positively
   evaluated, achieving a mean score of 6 out of 7 points. Additionally,
   the VL efficiency in the learning process showed a final examination
   main score of 8 out of 10 points. Last but not least, most students
   considered that the VL promoted learning and personal effort, being an
   excellent preparatory tool to real experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Virtual Reality (VR) technology in mining is a new field of research.
   The successful application of VR to mining is critical to mine safety
   and production. Based on different input/output devices that are used in
   the VR system, the current VR mining system can be divided into three
   types: screen-based general system, projector-based customized system,
   and Head Mount Display (HMD)-based intuitive system. Based on a VR
   headset, a smartphone and a Leap Motion, an HMD-based intuitive VR
   training system was built and tested by 10 students who tried both the
   HMD-based system and a normal screen-based system to experience the
   difference between the two systems. The results showed that the
   HMD-based system can give a better user experience, and is easier to
   use. In the future, with the employment of more intuitive input devices
   and improved system software, the VR training system for mines could
   play a much more important role in mine training.}},

Abstract = {{Manual operations in mass production are. important cost drivers. Thus,
   tools like the MTM (Methods-time Measurement) a time and motion study
   method were introduced, which are nowadays established in industry for
   evaluation and improvement of production facilities. In this method,
   cardboard engineering is used to build simplified physical mock-ups of
   machines or production lines, in which the manual working process can be
   simulated. However, new strategies like e.g. decentralized production
   require the worker to walk, which is not well incorporated in the MTM
   and times are only estimated from the walking distance.
   Since many workplaces, machines or production lines already exist as
   digital models, it is obvious to perform the MTM completely virtually.
   However, this comes at the cost of a complex handling and strongly
   reduced realism because a desktop-based MTM application does not allow
   natural navigation like walking within the full-sized models like the
   cardboard setups do.
   This paper introduces a virtual reality-based MTM that also allows for
   real walking in virtual factories without using a treadmill or other
   walking devices. With a subtle redirection of the user during walking,
   these virtual factories can even be larger than the available physical
   space. Hence, a realistic measuring of walking times and distances can
   be done instead of an estimation. Since the MTM can be completely
   performed within a virtual environment, it gives a new realism to the
   method compared to the cardboard procedure. The paper closes with an
   outlook on future work and extensions of this novel virtual MTM. (C)

Abstract = {{Real-time facial performance capture has recently been gaining
   popularity in virtual film production, driven by advances in machine
   learning, which allows for fast inference of facial geometry from video
   streams. These learning-based approaches are significantly influenced by
   the quality and amount of labelled training data. Tedious construction
   of training sets from real imagery can be replaced by rendering a facial
   animation rig under on-set conditions expected at runtime. We learn a
   synthetic actor-specific prior by adapting a state-of-the-art facial
   tracking method. Synthetic training significantly reduces the capture
   and annotation burden and in theory allows generation of an arbitrary
   amount of data. But practical realities such as training time and
   compute resources still limit the size of any training set. We construct
   better and smaller training sets by investigating which facial image
   appearances are crucial for tracking accuracy, covering the dimensions
   of expression, viewpoint and illumination. A reduction of training data
   in 1-2 orders of magnitude is demonstrated whilst tracking accuracy is
   retained for challenging on-set footage.}},

Abstract = {{In India, mining industry lacks technological innovation and the mining
   companies constantly striving to implement latest, reliable and cost
   effective automation technologies for their mines, to ensure high
   productivity and safety. Productivity of mines sometimes can be
   increased just by incorporating simple modifications in variables of the
   mine activities and operations which also boost up the safety
   conditions. Recent advancement in the technology especially with the
   application of Information Technology, it is now possible to identify
   the variables for improving existing production of mine with reduced
   operational cost, ensuring higher level of safety to the miners as well.
   Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is an effective tool to
   ensure safety in mining operations as it offers a real time tracking
   system during blasting and has the potential to revolutionise the mining
   operations. Radar technology has been widely popular for several decades
   globally, and can be a best tool to avert the hazards due to ground
   movement in surface mining. Field oriented training is of great
   importance in mining and realising that there is no substitute to the
   real life training, the mining sectors now-days tends to use different
   software to shorten the training time with ensuring the high quality of
   training. Virtual reality has the potential to cater the need of quality
   training with real time simulations of field conditions to the miners.

Abstract = {{Background: The French Military Health Service has standardized its
   military prehospital care policy in a ``Sauvetage au Combat'' (SC)
   program (Forward Combat Casualty Care). A major part of the SC training
   program relies on simulations, which are challenging and costly when
   dealing with more than 80,000 soldiers. In 2014, the French Military
   Health Service decided to develop and deploy 3D-SC1, a serious game (SG)
   intended to train and assess soldiers managing the early steps of SC.
   Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to describe the creation and
   production of 3D-SC1 and to present its deployment.
   Methods: A group of 10 experts and the Paris Descartes University
   Medical Simulation Department spin-off, Medusims, coproduced 3D-SC1.
   Medusims are virtual medical experiences using 3D real-time videogame
   technology (creation of an environment and avatars in different
   scenarios) designed for educational purposes (training and assessment)
   to simulate medical situations. These virtual situations have been
   created based on real cases and tested on mannequins by experts.
   Trainees are asked to manage specific situations according to best
   practices recommended by SC, and receive a score and a personalized
   feedback regarding their performance.
   Results: The scenario simulated in the SG is an attack on a patrol of 3
   soldiers with an improvised explosive device explosion as a result of
   which one soldier dies, one soldier is slightly stunned, and the third
   soldier experiences a leg amputation and other injuries. This scenario
   was first tested with mannequins in military simulation centers, before
   being transformed into a virtual 3D real-time scenario using a
   multi-support, multi-operating system platform, Unity. Processes of
   gamification and scoring were applied, with 2 levels of difficulty. A
   personalized debriefing was integrated at the end of the simulations.
   The design and production of the SG took 9 months. The deployment,
   performed in 3 months, has reached 84 of 96 (88\%) French Army units,
   with a total of 818 hours of connection in the first 3 months.
   Conclusions: The development of 3D-SC1 involved a collaborative platform
   with interdisciplinary actors from the French Health Service, a
   university, and videogame industry. Training each French soldier with
   simulation exercises and mannequins is challenging and costly.
   Implementation of SGs into the training program could offer a unique
   opportunity at a lower cost to improve training and subsequently the
   real-time performance of soldiers when managing combat casualties;
   ideally, these should be combined with physical simulations.}},

   novice welders. This study also used the shielded metal arc welding
   (SMAW) process to perform simple and complex welds. Performance was
   evaluated through a quality score, which was based on the following five
   welding parameters: arc length, position, work angle, travel angle, and
   travel speed. The virtual reality welding simulator was able to evaluate
   performance, but it could not distinguish between experienced and
   trained novice welders. On average, experienced welders as a group
   scored 10 quality points higher than trained novice welders. Welding
   experience also had a large to very large effect on the quality score
   for each weld type. One identified trend for both experienced and
   trained novice welders was as weld difficulty increased, the quality
   score decreased. It is recommended that industries use virtual reality
   simulators to evaluate welders for ensuring high-quality welding in

Abstract = {{As the technology improves and their cost decreases, tabletop computers
   and their inherent ability to promote collaboration amongst users are
   gaining in popularity. Their use in virtual reality-based applications
   including virtual training environments and gaming where multi-user
   interactions are common is poised to grow. However, before tabletop
   computers become widely accepted, there are many questions with respect
   to spatial sound production and reception for these devices that need to
   be addressed. Previous work (Lam et al. in ACM Comput Entertain 12(2):
   4: 1-4: 19, 2014) has seen the development of loudspeaker-based
   amplitude panning spatial sound techniques to spatialize a sound to a
   position on a plane just above a tabletop computer's (horizontal)
   surface. Although it has been established that the localization of these
   virtual sources is prone to error, there is a lack of ground truth
   (reference) data with which to compare these earlier results. Here, we
   present the results of an experiment that measured sound localization of
   an actual sound source on a horizontal surface, thus providing such
   ground truth data. This ground truth data were then compared with the
   results of previous amplitude panning-based spatial sound techniques for
   tabletop computing displays. Preliminary results reveal that no
   substantial differences exist between previous amplitude panning results
   and the ground truth data reported here, indicating that amplitude
   panning is a viable spatial sound technique for tabletop computing and
   horizontal displays in general.}},

Abstract = {{With the advances in computer technology nowadays, the virtual
   manufacturing technology has provided a new way in casting process
   design. In this study, a virtual reality system of casting production
   process named VR-Casting has been developed. The full range of virtual
   display about the casting process has been revealed under the network
   environment. Several key technologies applied in VR-Casting were
   introduced in this paper, such as a novel network running environment,
   the latest Web3D drawing standard named WebGL, levels of detail
   technology used for rendering on demand, and the detection and updating
   technology in the casting motions. Based on the above technologies,
   different 3D models and the virtual panoramic scene were established.
   Motion schema and user interface of the casting process was delicately
   designed to enable the system a better interactivity. The latest
   internet graphics standard WebGL was used to render the models. As
   VR-Casting is characterized as lightweight and cross-platform, it offers
   access to the visualization for various platforms and devices. The
   demonstration delivers VR-Casting has a broad application prospect like
   exhibition, education, training, and process analysis. Some tests were
   implemented on different devices, and the results demonstrated
   VR-Casting has a splendid performance when conducting tests on rendering
   models. When using VR-Casting, observer has a certain sense of immersion
   with arbitrarily adjusting of the observation angle and even watches
   deeply into the interior of the casts. Thus, observer can master the
   details in a more comprehensive and diverse way during the casting
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Serious games are growing more and more in the context of lifelong
   training and initial education. They cover several areas (human science,
   engineering science, life science,...) that are used for industrial or
   academic purposes. However, some fields induce specific issues. Thus, in
   the industrial area, the constraints inherent to the activity impact the
   development of a scenario and implementation of a serious gaming
   environment. Indeed, the objective of the industry training must both
   lead to the acquisition of knowledge and the transfer of skills.
   Moreover, the actual validation of these skills is paramount especially
   if their uses are located on an industrial site, where there are often
   risks associated with the security of persons and equipment. In many
   industries, some regulatory constraints impose an obligation of means
   for the training of staff. In the sector of production, the
   proliferation of interim requires inevitably targeted training. Finally,
   it should be noted that even for permanent staff, alternation and
   fragmentation of training periods seriously complicate the deep learning
   task. Finally, we can wonder if the serious game can bring relevant
   answers to specific problems of training in an industrial context? This
   article offers some answers to this question. Thus, in this work, we
   propose a serious game scripting framework adapted to the industrial
   context. This scripting framework is structured around two approaches:
   the first defines a global framework for scheduling a fun or playful
   scenario. Moreover, this framework allows to take into account the
   phases of availability of learners while maintaining motivation. The
   second approach defines an immersive framework for validating acquired
   and security compliance that is based on two complementary purposes: Use
   of alternate observation activities (games / real) and an immersive
   simulation (Virtual Reality) for security. In partnership with a company
   in the steel industry, we have developed a prototype of serious game in
   order to implement this scripting framework. The prototype is based on a
   generic game platform, on a tablet with use of RFID tag, and with an
   immersive virtual reality Head-Mounted-Display (HMD type Oculus). In
   this article we will present the actions realized in the context of a
   professional activity related to the manipulation of a bridge crane.}},

Abstract = {{In the Poznan University of Technology Chair of Production Engineering
   and Management, a Virtual Reality - Rapid Prototyping team has been
   active for many years and one of the studied activities is possibility
   of VR use in classes for higher education. As a result of cooperation
   with one of the medical universities in the region, an educational
   application has been developed, as a didactic aid during anatomy,
   physiology and pathology courses. During the test use, the application
   has been found quite interesting for both the lecturers and the
   students. It allowed, among other things, to freely slice the virtual
   human body and showing and hiding selected groups of organs, in order to
   allow detailed inspection of human anatomy by the user. This work
   continues in the study presented in this paper - they are aimed at
   expanding the simulation functionalities and allowing to conduct a
   training for the ultrasound examination. In many previous studies, it
   was proven that possibility of tracking the user's movements allows the
   simulation realism to be improved. It is a result of the phenomenon of
   immersion of the user in the virtual world. The immersion improves
   quality of the conducted virtual training and allows to better use the
   abilities learned during the course. In case of the ultrasound scanner,
   it is necessary to track both the position and the orientation of the
   device head, for proper generation of the virtual image of the insides
   of the human body. The paper discusses a process of adaptation of a head
   used in the ultrasound scan to application in the training simulation.
   Process of preparation and adaptation of the head geometry was
   described, along with a process of preparation of virtual and then
   physical prototypes using the 3D Printing technology. The prepared
   prototypes were covered with markers of the optical tracking system.
   Proper arrangement of the markers was implemented in the database and
   scenarios of work were prepared, to check correctness of gathering
   information about the ultrasound scanner head orientation and position
   in the three-dimensional space. Developed solutions were verified on a
   test group of users. Obtained results were presented in a form allowing

Abstract = {{Manufacturing industry is facing important challenges in terms of
   sustainability, flexibility, ramp-up and time-to-market shortening. This
   is pushing RTD towards digital tools and methods to simulate and test
   production processes before-hand and thus bridging the gaps between
   manufacturing engineering and production. For example, virtual training
   offers a huge potential to reduce the time and effort of traditional
   hardware training and thus leading to shorter production ramp-up time.
   However, before being deployed in an industrial environment, virtual
   training systems need to prove their reliability and user acceptance.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of gaming
   experience on the learning process of a manufacturing operation using
   the VIrtual Simulation and TRAining (VISTRA) system, a serious game that
   simulates manufacturing environments in order to train operators to
   perform manual tasks. The simulated operations take place at a welding
   workstation for truck chassis parts, where automation and manual tasks
   are combined. The case study aims then to evaluate the impact of
   gaming-experience and the general usability of the VISTRA system. Ten
   operators participated in the study; each operator completed five
   different training scenes on three difficulty levels each. Completion
   time and mistake count were computed by the VISTRA system after
   completing each training scene. This information was analyzed and
   compared. Results showed that: (1) users without gaming experience took
   considerably more time to complete the sequences than users with gaming
   experience, (2) the same amount of mistakes were made by gamers and by
   no-gamers, and (3) 50\% of the mistakes were made during a particular
   scene. The study thus found that gaming experience influences positively
   on training completion time using the VISTRA system. The particularities
   on the mistake count demonstrated that gaming experience does not
   influence the understanding of the manufacturing operation. Usability
   issues found on users' feedback are further discussed in terms of
   visualization, tools and parts, assisted-learning and ergonomics. (C)

Title = {{Measuring Sense of Presence and User Characteristics to Predict
   Effective Training in an Online Simulated Virtual Environment}},

   HEALTHCARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Virtual-reality solutions have successfully been used to train
   distributed teams. This study aimed to investigate the correlation
   between user characteristics and sense of presence in an online
   virtual-reality environment where distributed teams are trained. A
   greater sense of presence has the potential to make training in the
   virtual environment more effective, leading to the formation of teams
   that perform better in a real environment. Being able to identify,
   before starting online training, those user characteristics that are
   predictors of a greater sense of presence can lead to the selection of
   trainees who would benefit most from the online simulated training.
   Methods
   This is an observational study with a retrospective postsurvey of
   participants' user characteristics and degree of sense of presence.
   Twenty-nine members from 3 Air Force National Guard Medical Service
   expeditionary medical support teams participated in an online virtual
   environment training exercise and completed the Independent Television
   Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory survey, which measures sense of
   presence and user characteristics. Nonparametric statistics were applied
   to determine the statistical significance of user characteristics to
   sense of presence.
   Results
   Comparing user characteristics to the 4 scales of the Independent
   Television Commission-Sense of Presence Inventory using Kendall tau test
   gave the following results: the user characteristics ``how often you
   play video games{''} (tau(26) = -0.458, P < 0.01) and ``television/film
   production knowledge{''} (tau(27) = -0.516, P < 0.01) were significantly
   related to negative effects. Negative effects refer to adverse
   physiologic reactions owing to the virtual environment experience such
   as dizziness, nausea, headache, and eyestrain. The user characteristic
   ``knowledge of virtual reality{''} was significantly related to
   engagement (tau(26) = 0.463, P < 0.01) and negative effects (tau(26) =
   -0.404, P < 0.05).
   Conclusions
   Individuals who have knowledge about virtual environments and experience
   with gaming environments report a higher sense of presence that
   indicates that they will likely benefit more from online virtual
   training. Future research studies could include a larger population of
   expeditionary medical support, and the results obtained could be used to
   create a model that predicts the level of presence based on the user
   characteristics. To maximize results and minimize costs, only those
   individuals who, based on their characteristics, are supposed to have a
   higher sense of presence and less negative effects could be selected for
   online simulated virtual environment training.}},

Abstract = {{Existing and evolving trends and paradigms in manufacturing, such as
   mass customisation and personalisation, call for better communication
   among product-production design and customisation and production
   execution. Specifically, the lack of feedback from and to the shopfloor
   can lead to lower product quality and increased production times. In
   state-of-the-art industrial practices, the most common visual interface
   devices for communication comprise control unit terminals, TFT monitors
   mounted over work stations, as well as the growing trend of mobile PCs
   and tablets. New technologies, such as Augmented Reality (AR), have also
   been considered in academic research for process simulation and operator
   guidance and training. This paper proposes a novel use of AR goggles,
   coupled with other mobile devices for the communication of people,
   working on the shopfloor and in the engineering offices. The proposed
   methodology tries to address the challenges, related to the use of both
   technologies (and their respective interfaces) by presenting an
   integrated approach: the use of a mobile device as an input device and
   as a fiducial marker for the positioning of a virtual screen in front of
   the user. After the presentation of the concept, its advantages and
   disadvantages, compared with current practices as well with the rest of
   the relevant academic work, are presented. The technical implementation
   to be realised, including specific software frameworks that will be used
   is also described. Special attention is given to the data models that
   will support the implementation of this approach as well as to show how
   they can be integrated into the existing systems and practices. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Purpose-The purpose of this research is to develop a learning system
   architecture, based on the knowledge management supported into a valid
   platform, for a globalized production training for disabled women, based
   on their capabilities, skills, and feelings as a tacit knowledge. In
   this context it is necessary to identify a profile which needs
   interaction with the virtual words. The process is completed through the
   developing of a model based on the interaction of the participants with
   intelligent agents, using the MPML3D language and which works through a
   collaborative learning process. The results are validated in a prototype
   for being tested and discussed.
   Design/methodology/approach-Virtual worlds are part of the extensive
   field of ``shared space{''} technologies, as are Augmented Reality,
   Telepresence and Virtual Reality, all discrete spaces represented and
   executed by computers and accessed exclusively through the Internet.
   Virtual worlds have technological capabilities to support the generation
   of knowledge and collaborative learning through the interaction of
   avatars (human-controlled avatar) and these ones with intelligent agents
   (avatars controlled by a machine), developing a collaborative
   information and training system, which in turn may support a platform
   for training and production of women with physical disabilities.
   Originality/value-This research presents a model that allows women with
   physical disabilities to overcome their limitations due to physical
   constraints of the real world so they can become into productive and
   globalized persons, taking advantage from the economy of virtual worlds
   as Second Life.
   The State of the Art of the above mentioned technologies, the specific
   characteristics of women with physical disabilities and the
   characteristics of virtual worlds, can generate capabilities that enable
   a collaborative learning through the interaction with intelligent agents
   (avatars controlled by a machine), which are able to answer frequently
   asked questions to avatars (human-controlled avatar), who in turn can
   generate actions from the agents within the virtual world. These agents
   allow a permanent support without the limitations of fixed schedules,
   personalizing the training without the barriers of the traditional
   process of education.
   Practical implications-The practical implications of the model proposed
   lies in three main areas:
   Productive women who overcome physical limitations due to their
   disability.
   Learning environments, based on low-cost emerging technologies.
   Globalization of people with mobility problems even from developing
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of using Augmented Reality (AR) user interfaces (UIs) to create
   3D media content, such as 3D models for movies and games has been
   repeatedly suggested over the last decade. Even though the concept is
   intuitively compelling and recent technological advances have made such
   an application increasingly feasible, very little progress has been made
   towards an actual real-world application of AR in professional media
   production. To this day, no immersive 3D UI has been commonly used by
   professionals for 3D computer graphics (CG) content creation.
   In this paper, we are first to publish a requirements analysis for our
   target application in the professional domain. Based on a survey that we
   conducted with media professionals, the analysis of professional 3D CG
   software, and professional training tutorials, we identify these
   requirements and put them into the context of AR UIs. From these
   findings, we derive several interaction design principles that aim to
   address the challenges of real-world application of AR to the production
   pipeline. We implemented these in our own prototype system while
   receiving feedback from media professionals. The insights gained in the
   survey, requirements analysis, and user interface design are relevant
   for research and development aimed at creating production methods for 3D
   media production.}},

Abstract = {{The ``Digital Factory{''} concept is one of the key tools of success on
   the market. Today it can be treated as a highly actual issue in the
   conditions of manufacturing plants. ``Digital Factory{''} concept is a
   generic professional terminology for a comprehensive network of digital
   models, methods, techniques and tools, including simulation and
   virtual-reality visualization; which are integrated by a continuous data
   management system. The objectives of a ``Digital Factory{''} concept are
   different; for example reorganization of the production lines and
   optimization of the production through the simulation of the production
   cycle; training of the workers; working on a virtual prototype in design
   phase; virtual environment is a good network place where people can
   virtually meet to co-design the product or the production line. The
   ``Digital Factory{''} concept application has become more and more
   important for complex design of products that are tailoring for
   customers.
   This paper is divided into four main parts. In the first part, the
   literature is reviewed in the field of Digital Factory, and some basic
   and key terms are defined. In the second part, the research design and
   research methodology is described. The paper is based on an extensive
   review of secondary sources, including analysis and synthesis of
   domestic and foreign professional literary sources. The methods for
   preparation of scientific research are applied, the methods of gaining
   new data, methods of data processing. Additional methods used are the
   analysis and interpretation of the concept of ``Digital Factory{''}
   characteristics and published data. In the third part of this paper, an
   overview of the project int. Nb. 6111 entitled, Increasing Technical
   Knowledge Base and Practical Skills of Teachers and Students of the
   Institute of Industrial Engineering and Management within the concept of
   ``Digital Factory{''} is presented. This project supports new
   possibilities for cooperation and creates the networks between
   educational institutions and manufacturing enterprises within the
   ``Digital Factory{''} concept. The target groups of this project are
   qualified university teachers, students and industrial enterprises
   operating in Slovak Republic and abroad, mainly operating in the
   manufacturing industry. In the final part, the findings are clarified -
   firstly, the key results are summarized and secondly the limitation of
   the work are discussed; areas for future development are suggested.
   The following paper is one of the outcomes of the research work for the
   project int. Nb. 6111 entitled ``Increasing Technical Knowledge Base and
   Practical Skills of Teachers and Students of the Institute of Industrial
   Engineering and Management within the ``Digital Factory{''} concept,

Abstract = {{In modern manufacturing it is crucial to be able to produce a product
   right first time, as efficiently as possible. Virtual prototyping can
   play a key part in fulfilling this requirement, allowing the simulation
   of production in advance without the need for unnecessary downtime,
   material waste or increased lead times. This makes, virtual reality (VR)
   potentially an ideal planning tool since, with each simulation, a better
   understanding of requirements can be reached and a more effective
   solution found.
   This application of haptic virtual reality is particularly relevant in
   the field of machining where both material and resource costs are high.
   Planning for the machining of a product requires an intricate knowledge
   of materials, processes and machining methods. Intuitive virtual reality
   interfaces can provide new, engineer-friendly means of generating such
   manufacturing sequences.
   Current research in haptic virtual reality focuses on specific
   individual aspects of machining such as path planning or simulation for
   training; however, in order to simulate multi-operation machining with a
   view to generating practical and usable process plans, in which there
   are several processes involved in bringing a product to fruition; an
   approach is required which allows this type of functionality.
   This paper presents such a haptic virtual process planning system that
   allows an operator to load and set up a billet for machining, set up,
   sequence and tear down any combination of milling, drilling or turning
   operations then produce a time-estimated process plan. All of the human
   expertise captured during this process is logged and parsed to generate
   the final instructions including operation times, tool lists, operation
   lists and route sheets in easy-to-read format.
   Via three planning examples, the generation of process plans is
   demonstrated; with these subsequently validated through their use by a
   shop floor machinist who utilised them to produce the parts, and a
   comparison to previously existing plans for the same parts. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Effective applied research is based on close collaboration between
   research and industry, which, taking the findings of basic research on

   examination of global trends such as demographic change, growing
   megacities, rising energy consumption and increasing traffic and the
   resultant social challenges. These trends and increasing traffic in
   particular are giving rise to new fields of work, especially for digital

Abstract = {{Virtual education also known as e-learning is a form of distance
   education that is aided primarily Internet and its many tools.
   Universities twentieth century saw at the e-learning system, an
   alternative to start teaching some courses, specialties, and as time has
   been moving, now offers undergraduate (professional careers) and in more
   recent years even offer postgraduate education.
   Since the beginning of virtual universities in the late twentieth
   century, the information and communication technologies have evolved
   exponentially, with changes in the models of teaching, learning and
   educational management.
   Therefore, those models that explained how to work in virtual
   universities in the twentieth century, are currently facing not only the
   incorporation of new technologies but also new educational models such
   as competency-based model and thus the challenges and adequacy of
   educational elements such as the roles of teachers now called tutors,
   the student activities and digital administration This article presents
   the main results of research being done at the National Polytechnic
   Institute (Mexico) from the early experiences of implementing a Masters
   online using the Moodle learning platform. We will compare the proposed
   models for virtual universities and the reality that is lived in a
   particular online Master of this institution.
   Even though the basic elements of any model of Virtual University
   includes considering the users, production and design courses, equipment
   / technology, training, among other things, we can mention that despite
   the decades and technological development, virtual education not only
   aims to provide online content.}},

Abstract = {{Modern smelters have made the reduction process efficiency and safety a
   key issue: produce more, faster in a safer environment. By designing and
   developing highly technical automated machines, equipment suppliers
   greatly help and support smelters in their objective. However it must be
   acknowledged that despite such innovation, human remains at the very
   heart of any operation (reduction process, operations on anode handling
   in the furnace area or rodding shop) and has a significant impact on it.
   To avoid production losses, reduce maintenance cost and increase safety
   reflexes of the crane operators in case of emergency, ECL (TM) has
   recently endowed its PTM simulator with some new revolutionary
   functions. The operator, facing a double screen on which a 3D virtual
   environment is generated, will be now equipped with some 3D glasses
   putting him in a total virtual reality (Cabin rotation, cranes
   translations).
   Well trained, the operator will fully contribute to improve production
   and increase safety of the smelter.}},

Abstract = {{This work is related to the compulsory subject `Product Presentation',
   taught in the Degree in Industrial Design and Product Development at the
   Universitat Jaume I of Castellon, and outlines the methodologies and
   results of an educational improvement project successfully implemented
   in the past academic year. This project aimed to improve the student's
   skills by strengthening the teaching methodology through seminars and
   activities, involving external professionals and the use of tools based
   on new technologies of information and communication.
   Among the objectives of the improvement project we considered that the
   students should be able to analyze the formal aspects of the products
   that have direct impact on their relationship with the user, learn to
   visualize and express graphically the role of the packages or their
   parts, practice ergonomic research methodologies and be trained to
   conduct a critical analysis. All these objectives are intended to
   develop the professional skills of students, since they must work in a
   project that should be presented at the end of the course as
   professional as possible, by having to implement their industrial
   production.
   The project conducted some activities using the Moodle-based `Virtual
   Classroom' platform. Among these activities was learning Prezi software
   for project presentations, a seminar on a photo editing software tool
   and three lectures given by renowned professionals in the fields of
   design, photography and video editing. In this way, due to the work of
   visiting professionals we were able to help students to become aware
   about the reality of their profession and their socio-economic
   environment, perceiving the whole of the proposed exercises differently
   than mere academic proposals.}},

Title = {{Construction industry offsite production: A virtual reality interactive
   training environment prototype}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The `traditional' construction industry has constantly been challenged
   to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite production (OSP),
   under the umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC), has been
   acknowledged as a means to help improve construction industry
   performance as well as meet new market demands through the provision of
   improved, adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment
   of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end
   result and be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
   construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the specifics,
   merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP systems in order to
   achieve the desired outcomes and consequently improve industry
   performance.
   On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate `experiential'
   learning, which is argued to be particularly effective where a great
   deal of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has
   been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of
   the actual training context. In order to address the problems
   encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been
   proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype, in order
   to provide a risk-free environment for learning without the `do-or-die'
   consequences often faced on real construction projects. The proffered
   solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new working
   conditions associated with OSP practices. While the `scenes' of the VR
   environment take place on a construction site, the environment
   predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers,
   construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and
   manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence
   overcome `knowledge silos' or `knowledge compartmentation'. The VR
   environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by professionals'
   decisions, faulty work, and health and safety issues to occur: where the
   implications of which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and
   resources. The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
   associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow `things to go wrong'
   and consequently allows users not only to `experience' the resulting
   implications but also to reflect on those implications as part of the
   learning process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for
   the first development phase of the VR interactive training environment.
   While the prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
   industry, the research community, and academia from different EU
   countries, the data used in developing the prototype was constrained to
   one project in the UK which may limit the generalisability of results.

Abstract = {{Manufacturing facilities are expected to maintain a high level of
   production and at the same time, employ strict safety standards to
   ensure the safe evacuation of the people in the event of emergencies
   (fire is considered in this paper). These two goals are often
   conflicting. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate evacuation
   safety versus productivity concurrently for various, widely known
   manufacturing layouts. While the safety performance indicators such as
   evacuation times are inferred from the crowd (agent based) simulation,
   the productivity performance indicators (e.g. throughput) are analyzed
   using the discrete event simulation. To this end, this research focuses
   on creating innovative techniques for developing accurate crowd
   simulations, where Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent framework is
   employed to build each person's individual actions and the interactions
   between them. The data model and rule based action algorithms for each
   agent are reverse-engineered from the human-in-the-loop experiments in
   the immersive virtual reality environments. Finally, experiments are
   conducted using the constructed simulations to compare safety and
   productivity for different layouts. To demonstrate the proposed
   methodology, an automotive power-train (engine and transmission)
   manufacturing plant was used. Initial results look quite promising. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cognitive and
   physical impact of virtual reality (VR) integrated training versus
   traditional training methods in the domain of weld training.
   Background: Weld training is very important in various industries and
   represents a complex skill set appropriate for advanced training
   intervention. As such, there has been a long search for the most
   successful and most cost-effective method for training new welders.
   Method: Participants in this study were randomly assigned to one of two
   separate training courses taught by sanctioned American Welding Society
   certified welding instructors; the duration of each course was 2 weeks.
   After completing the training for a specific weld type, participants
   were given the opportunity to test for the corresponding certification.
   Participants were evaluated in terms of their cognitive and physical
   parameters, total training time exposure, and welding certification
   awards earned. Each of the four weld types taught in this study
   represented distinct levels of difficulty and required the development
   of specialized knowledge and skills.
   Results: This study demonstrated that participants in the VR integrated
   training group (VR50) performed as well as, and in some cases,
   significantly outperformed, the traditional welding (TW) training group.
   The VR50 group was found to have a 41.6\% increase in overall
   certifications earned compared with the TW group.
   Conclusion: VR technology is a valuable tool for the production of
   skilled welders in a shorter time and often with more highly developed
   skills than their traditionally trained counterparts.
   Application: These findings strongly support the use of VR integrated
   training in the welding industry.}},

Abstract = {{The Virtual Reality (VR) is an advanced technology whose usage grew
   steadily over the past years. As it is important that future engineers
   learn how to use advanced technologies during their studies, it is
   important to include VR in the engineering education, especially at
   universities. This paper presents the use of the VR technology in
   different areas of engineering education at universities. It will be
   described how VR can be used to improve lectures. In contrast to the use
   for exercises and practical training, discussed next, lectures target
   large groups of students. In addition to use VR to enrich the
   visualization of the teaching subject, VR can be a teaching object
   itself; for the students to learn how to use VR. Finally it is described
   how students can use VR for their research projects and theses.
   For the presented applications of the VR technology for educational
   purposes, the chances it holds, and the challenges that need to be
   solved, will be discussed. Those challenges are especially the creation
   of the VR content, the possibilities for interaction within the VR
   environment as well as the integration of VR in a didactic concept.
   In summary, this paper will show how the use of Virtual Reality systems
   for educational purposes at universities will improve the imparting of
   complex issues and therefore enables a faster and more purposeful expert
   education. It will outline how the visualization of the relevant
   teaching content, using the virtual-interactive environment in
   combination with practical training, will help to improve the training
   results.}},

Abstract = {{After a stroke, many survivors have impaired motor function. Robotic
   rehabilitation techniques have emerged to provide a repetitive,
   activity-based therapy at potentially lower cost than conventional
   methods. Many patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to hand extension in
   the form of spasticity and/or hypertonia. We have developed a therapy
   program using the Hand Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot (HEXORR) that is
   capable of compensating for tone to assist patients in opening the
   paretic hand. The system can move the user's hand, assist movement,
   allow free movement, or restrict movement to allow static force
   production. These options combine with an interactive virtual reality
   game to enhance user motivation. Four chronic stroke subjects received
   18 sessions of robot therapy as well as pre and post evaluation
   sessions. All subjects showed at least modest gains in active finger
   range of motion (ROM) measured in the robot, and all but one subject had
   gains in active thumb ROM. Most of these gains carried over to ROM gains
   outside of the robot. The clinical measures (Fugl-Meyer, Box-and-Blocks)
   showed clear improvements in two subjects and mixed results in two
   subjects. Overall, the robot therapy was well received by subjects and
   shows promising results. We conclude HEXORR therapy is best suited for
   patients with mild-moderate tone and at least minimal extension.}},

Abstract = {{Petrochemical industry, which adopts oil and natural gas as raw
   material, is more dangerous than any other industry on account of the
   characteristics of combustibility and explosion. The craft and process
   of production are rather complicated at the same time. Consequently, it
   is extremely perilous once the fire hazard is taken place in the
   petrochemical industry enterprises resulting in severe consequence. The
   virtual reality technique is applied in this paper to develop a computer
   simulation training system for fire fighting and rescue with regard to
   the disaster accidents of petrochemical industry in order to launch the
   tactics training for fireman and enhance the fire fighting troops'
   tactical capability of putting out petrochemical fire hazard. Such
   system simulates the 3-D scene for petrochemical plant by utilizing
   virtual reality technique. Several similar real fire hazard scenes are
   provided according to distinct accidental patterns for the purpose of
   instructing fireman to adopt correspondent fire fighting and rescue
   tactics measure. The 3-D model of 3DMAX is called in the software of
   quest3d by programming. The scene including flame, smoke and fire water
   beam is described by means of particle system modeling technique. The
   considerable investment of funds and installations, which is used to
   satisfy, the fire fighting and rescue training requirement in
   petrochemical fire hazard, can be resolved, as well as the influence on
   the enterprise production. The influence on training in conventional
   process, which is caused by the environment, meteorology, cost and so
   on, is also effectively solved}},

Abstract = {{Many architects, whether they are well-known or not, have developed
   essential architectural concepts and created significant works of
   architecture. The cultural implication for society, but specially their
   significance in relation to the architectural practice is enormous.
   Most of these designers did not make use of the currently so called new
   media to explore and elaborate their design ideas.
   Every design process is for all architects a process of `conversation
   with oneself'. Visualization media facilitate this process and make it
   even possible. The media record the different moments along the whole
   design process and, as a result, these visual records provide the
   designer with the necessary feedback.
   Departing from the actual state of the art regarding architectural
   visualization, but specifically avoiding the limitations of the
   exclusive use of computer modeling and rendering, the students at our
   department review and explore those ideas.
   But the context we experience architecture is changing. Not only for
   designers but also for an extensive public within our society, the
   visual media play nowadays an immense role.
   Moreover, we stay, meet and chat more and more within virtual spaces.
   How does this all relate to the exploration of architecture?
   mEYEmedia\&I is the name of the Minor offered by the Department of Media
   Studies of the Faculty of Architecture at the Delft University of
   Technology in the Netherlands.
   The Department of Media Studies and its students explore the role the
   diverse available media play during the complete design process.
   Students get also trained in the different communication and
   visualization media.
   In this paper we further elaborate the contents of the Minor:
   mEYEmedia\&I is about communication, about different ways, analogue and
   digital, to develop, evaluate and communicate design ideas.
   During the minor, important concepts and works of architecture are
   revisited by the designers themselves, now `reincarnated' in
   contemporary students. They explore and take advantage of the
   opportunities and limitations of the various at present available
   techniques.
   The combination of all these visual media -we introduce here the name
   augmented media for it-allows designers to explore space in many new,
   different ways and to better compose, develop and communicate their
   design ideas.
   In addition to the media training, the students mainly work on a media
   production. Making use of an augmented reality-like approach, they
   perform research on techniques that combine images of the real world
   with analogue and digital representations.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of Discrete Event Systems with 3D simulation and control
   technology to set up versatile virtual environments seems to be at the
   first glance a contradiction in terms because of mixing up two totally
   different application classes. But here, the newly developed State
   Oriented Modeling methodology comes into play providing a comprehensive
   and flexible object oriented framework for the development of complex
   Discrete Event Systems. State Oriented Modeling establishes a link
   between these two worlds using object oriented Petri Nets {[}10] for the
   discrete part as well as application specific mappings between
   continuous and discrete state variables realizing so called 3D Discrete
   Event Systems. Integrated in a versatile 3D simulation system, State
   Oriented Modeling allows for the efficient realization of a large class
   of applications within the large field of virtual environments. It
   provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use but nevertheless efficient
   framework for behavior modeling in virtual worlds and real-time
   simulation applications. When modeling virtual production lines for
   example, State Oriented Modeling provides an easy way for a
   close-to-reality simulation of automation systems starting with the
   control of simple actuators or sensors and ending with the supervisory
   control of the entire virtual factory. In the field of Projective
   Virtual Reality {[}4] State Oriented Modeling supervises the user's work
   in the virtual environment to derive his ``intention{''} and then
   generates appropriate command sequences for intelligent automation
   hardware. This way, even complex automation systems which may be far
   away or even in space can be controlled - and the user must not be an
   automation expert. In the field of interactive visualization and
   training environments State Oriented Modeling simulates a variety of
   dynamic objects in the virtual world, integrates interaction components
   like 2D control elements or application specific driver seats into the
   virtual environment and supervises training sessions to derive
   performance indicators. And, in addition to this, State Oriented
   Modeling is the basis for a new multi-agent and discrete event based
   approach to realize the virtual human.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of standard methodologies to guide and organize game design can
   result in longer and less predictable game production processes.
   Moreover, the need for interaction among domain experts (providing the
   instructional content) and game developers is a peculiar aspect of
   serious games that makes their development more difficult. This paper
   focuses on the design of games for procedural training, and proposes to
   adopt a task modeling technique (ConcurTaskTrees, CTT {[}15]) in the
   modeling of training scenarios. In particular, we show how CTT can be
   used to (i) analyze and structure pedagogical content about the
   procedures, (ii) support and monitor procedure execution in the game. We
   also describe how we employed CTT in the design of a serious game for
   training nurses in emergency medical procedures on disabled patients.}},

Abstract = {{Desktop computers based virtual training systems are attracting
   paramount attention from manufacturing industries due to their potential
   advantages over the conventional training practices. Significant cost
   savings can be realized due to the shorter training-scenarios
   development times and reuse of existing engineering models. In addition,
   by using computer based virtual reality (VR) training systems, the time
   span from the product design to commercial production can be shortened
   due to non-reliance on hardware parts. Within the aforementioned
   conceptual framework, a haptically enabled interactive and immersive
   virtual reality (HIIVR) system is presented. Unlike existing VR systems,
   the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by
   providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the
   physical limitations of the real world imposed by the haptics devices
   within the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing
   VR systems, capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly
   sequences only, the proposed system helps in procedural learning and
   procedural skill development as well, due to its high physically
   interactive nature.}},

Abstract = {{The changing demographics of the mining industry make successful passing
   of knowledge and skills to the next generation critical. Training
   methods and technologies are being developed to meet this need. Twenty
   years ago classroom training was largely a one-way transfer of knowledge
   through instructor lectures. In contrast, instructors today can use
   virtual reality technologies to guide trainees as they fully participate
   in learning experiences. Trainees can interact with the virtual work
   environment, co-workers, and equipment without being exposed to
   workplace hazards. The speed of advancement in mine safety, health, and
   production training shows no sign of slowing in the next 20 years.
   Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
   have studied and participated in the evolution of miner training. A look
   at training materials they have created in the past and those they are
   currently developing reveals changes in methods and technologies over
   time and also key characteristics which have remained constant.
   Possibilities for the future can be discussed in the framework of an
   implementation of virtual reality in new miner training sessions. The
   example computer-based training package teaches new miners to read mine
   maps and provides opportunity to practice navigation skills in it
   virtual mine. With this `serious game', trainees experience the look and
   feel of moving through an underground coal mine while in the safety of
   their classroom. During field-testing in 2007, trainees and instructors
   responded very favourably to this new way of learning. The software was
   usable by mine trainers with even limited computer expertise and could
   be installed on the affordable computers they were using for their more
   traditional slide presentations. The Underground Coal Mine Map Reading
   Training's foundation on past successful development strategies and its
   acceptance by today's instructors and trainees provide valuable lessons
   for developing training materials, strategies, and technologies for
   mining's future.}},

Abstract = {{German hard coal mining operations have decreased for more than 40
   years. Current political decisions are leading to a discontinuation of
   subsidised black coal mining by the year 2018. This decision will,
   however, be reviewed once again in the year 2012. The enormous increases
   in productivity, which were achieved in previous years, have so far not
   led to an achievement of market requirements. Coal mining at depth of
   more than 1200 in in multiple seam environments is not yet competitive
   in global comparison. In 2009 the 24 faces left in eight mines produced
   about 20 million tonnes of usable steam coal. Management and the
   workforce will be reduced in parallel; from today until 2012 by more
   than half. The average age of personnel is increasing dramatically and
   nearly no new personnel are recruited.
   With this background in mind, increasing continuously coal mining
   productivity becomes more and more difficult. Above all, this goal was
   reached by mechanisation, then by increasing the mining machine power
   and then by enhanced machine control systems. The first attempts to
   automatically operate full face equipment from above ground were in the
   early 1980s. After successful automation of the face equipment, the
   emphasis is now on mine logistics. Autonomous monorail transport was
   introduced and tested in 2007. Since the development rate of machine
   improvements has its limits, the focus is on the full interaction of the
   total production system. Here information technology (IT) becomes
   important; the driver for more productivity.
   Actual developments aim for the complete and general homogeneous IT
   infrastructure both above ground as well its underground. The explosive
   environment needs high level investments in safe technology, cl; access
   points for WLAN and fibre optics for underground use (ATEX
   certification). New technology availability also drives the enhancements
   of management and process control systems.
   Innovations in the mining industry often comprise technology advances
   through the adoption of well-known technologies. With virtual reality
   (VR) leaching and training systems advanced computational instruments,
   both in software and hardware development, were applied in the German
   coal mining industry for ten years. Widening lists of applications as
   well as the encouraging achievements show the economical benefits of
   investing in virtual reality technology both for leaching and training
   and for knowledge management.
   The paper discusses the actual technical achievements as well as in IT
   infrastructure utilisation and also in employment of virtual reality
   based systems. Special focus and deeper insight will be given to the
   fibre optics and WLAN hardware integration as well as Software
   developments. The pocket personal computer (PC) is used to enhance
   underground material transport and data acquisition. The knowledge-based
   maintenance system (KBMS) integrates real-time virtual reality knowledge
   elements, such as repair process descriptions. It gives access to expert
   documentation by intelligent search algorithms and 3D representations of
   major mining machinery.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional robot programming such as teach by lead etc have been used
   for many years. These methods are considered not efficient and outdated
   in the current industrial and market demands. In this paper, virtual
   reality (VR) technology is used to improve human-robot interface - no
   complicated command or programming knowledge is required. The system is
   divided into three major parts: task teaching by demonstration in a
   computer generated virtual environment, a graphical robot simulator with
   intelligent robot command generator and last but not least, real task
   execution. The user is requested to complete the desired task in a
   virtual teaching system by wearing a data glove attached with a sensor
   tracker. The process path will be simulated and analyzed to obtain the
   optimum trajectory. Robot motions can be checked through the simulation
   program and robot program can be generated for the real task execution.
   Significance: The designed VR-based system has overcome the safety
   issues and the lack of trained personnel. Simple and user-friendly
   interfaces are designed for inexperienced staff to generate robot
   command without damage the robot or interrupting the production line.
   They can try many times to obtain the optimum solution.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade the competitive environment of manufacturing
   enterprises has changed considerably (Stalk and Hout, 1992). An initial
   emphasis on quality became the baseline from which to compete since high
   levels of quality quickly became taken for granted by customers, The
   focus of competitive attention then became those of reducing delivery
   lead time and improving delivery reliability (Bernard. 2004). In more
   recent years the provision of increasing levels of product choice and
   continuous reductions in costs have been added to the competitive mix.
   There is now increasing pressure on suppliers to provide higher levels
   of cost, quality and delivery performance in addition to ensuring the
   availability of a wider choice of products.
   An essential methodology, increasingly being adopted by manufacturing
   organisations, that is capable of assisting manufacturing organisations
   in fulfilling these competitive demands is that of lean production which
   has been shown to provide (Monden 1983, Womack, Jones and Roos 1990,
   Smeds 1990, Yusuf 2002) significant advantages in the critical areas of
   shortening lead times, improving delivery reliability, reducing costs,
   improving quality, and widening product mixes.
   Studies have shown that organisations making use of lean production
   techniques tend to have significant performance advantages over
   conventionally organised plants (Smeds 1990, Schonberger 1992. Chappell
   2002). There is also research that has reported the limitations of the
   lean philosophy, most notably Burgelman, (1993), who argues that
   environmental and social conditions have not been taken fully into
   consideration in explaining the use of lean production in Japan's
   competitive advantage. However, it is generally accepted that lean
   manufacturing practices have the ability to provide improvements in the
   majority of those areas considered critical to the competitiveness of an
   organisation.
   The paper will discuss a collaborative R\&D project which will
   accelerate the adoption and use of lean practices within a wide range of
   industrial and service sectors. A Virtual Discrete Event Process
   Simulation (V-DEPS) tool will be developed capable of providing a
   learning, training and decision support environment for lean
   practitioners from complete novices to experienced lean champions. Novel
   virtual process modelling, discrete event simulation, advanced
   visualisation and adaptive optimisation tools will be developed that
   enable self-organisation of improvement teams, and provide assistance
   with identifying \& prioritising problems, creative problem solving \&
   autonomous decision-making and lean solution optimisation \&
   implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual studios have long been used in commercial broadcasting. However,
   most virtual studios are based on ``blue screen{''} technology, and its
   two-dimensional (2-D) nature restricts the user from making natural
   three-dimensional (3-D) interactions. Actors have to follow prewritten
   scripts and pretend as if directly interacting with the synthetic
   objects. This often creates an unnatural and seemingly uncoordinated
   output. In this paper, we introduce an improved virtual-studio framework
   to enable actors/users to interact in 3-D more naturally with the
   synthetic environment and objects. The proposed system uses a stereo
   camera to first construct a 3-D environment (for the actor to act in), a
   multiview camera to extract the image and 3-D information about the
   actor, and a real-time registration and rendering software for
   generating the final output. Synthetic 3-D objects can be easily
   inserted and rendered, in real time, together with the 3-D environment
   and video actor for natural 3-D interaction. The enabling of natural 3-D
   interaction would make more cinematic techniques possible including live
   and spontaneous acting. The proposed system is not limited to broadcast
   production, but can also be used for creating virtual/augmented-reality
   environments for training and entertainment.}},

Abstract = {{Users are increasingly recognizing the potential of virtual reality (VR)
   technology for applications such as data analysis, design review,
   product development, production planning, marketing, training, etc. The
   currently established workflow is to design and construct at a desktop
   system with CAD or modeling software, and visualize and evaluate the
   results at one or more VR centers equipped with CAVEs or Powerwalls.
   Discussions with users of VR installations have shown that there is a
   demand for smaller and more cost efficient VR installations. We have
   proposed the concept of a small VR system, PI-casso, based on user
   requirements, guidelines for office workplaces and some end-user tests
   which showed important limitations and the ergonomics problems of
   current VR installations. PI-casso is a compact, fully immersive VR
   system which complements the classic desktop workplace.
   In this paper we describe a set of user requirements and the results of
   the design in forming end-user tests, in addition to the concept and the
   technical specifications of the newly developed system. The first
   prototype of PI-casso was demonstrated at HCH 2003, where specialists
   from the human factors/ergonomics and the VR communities used our system
   and provided suggestions for improvement. This expert feedback was used
   to develop the improved versions described in this paper. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Laparoscopic trainers have been shown to be
   effective tools for transitioning residents in surgical fields into live
   laparoscopic techniques. There have been few reports of homemade
   trainers, but each of these reports provides only scant detail about
   their construction, making production a novel task to those interested
   in employing this equipment. Virtual-reality trainers are gaining
   popularity and are exceptional modalities in the re-creation of
   laparoscopic surgery. In their present state, however, such trainers are
   very costly, making them unattainable by most urology residency
   programs. Numerous commercial non-virtual trainers are also available;
   however, these trainers are often cost-prohibitive or overly simplistic.
   Methods and Results: We describe a detailed design template for creation
   of a laparoscopic trainer based on modifications of previous designs.
   This trainer can be made easily at a cost of approximately US\$275.00
   and may be used in conjunction with existing laparoscopic equipment. The
   methods described herein can be followed by any local machinist to
   create this trainer.
   Conclusion: The relatively low total cost, ready material availability,
   and ease of construction make this trainer an appropriate option for the
   training of residents in laparoscopic procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays companies operate in a difficult environment: the dynamics of
   innovations increase and product life cycles become shorter. Furthermore
   products and the corresponding manufacturing processes get more and more
   complex. Therefore, companies need new methods for the planning of
   manufacturing systems. One promising approach in this context is digital
   factory/virtual production-the modeling and analysis of computer models
   of the planned factory with the objective to reduce time and costs, For
   the modeling and analysis various simulation methods and programs have
   been developed. They are a highly valuable support for planning and
   visualizing the manufacturing system. But there is one major
   disadvantage: only experienced and long trained experts are able to
   operate with these programs. The graphical user interface is very
   complex and not intuitive to use. This results in an extensive and
   error-prone modeling of complex simulation models and a time-consuming
   interpretation of the simulation results.
   To overcome these weak points, intuitive and understandable man-machine
   interfaces like augmented and virtual reality can be used. This paper
   describes the architecture of a system which uses the technologies of
   augmented and virtual reality to support the planning process of complex
   manufacturing systems. The proposed system assists the user in modeling,
   the validation of the simulation model, and the subsequent optimization
   of the production system. A general application of the VR- and
   AR-technologies and of the simulation is realized by the development of
   appropriate linking and integration mechanisms. For the visualization of
   the arising 3D-data within the VR- and AR-environments. a dedicated

   simple interactive web-based training tool for CAD in a virtual

Abstract = {{Today's robot applications often include multi-robot multi-user
   environments which are planed thoroughly in 3D before installation. The
   key to gain the maximum benefit out of the already available models it
   is to reuse them for other purposes than only robot-simulation. One of
   these aspects surely is the training of future operators of the cell
   which is important especially for environments that are difficult to
   access for training. For example a production line in the automotive
   industry may not be shut down for a day of emergency-training.
   In this paper we will show how to reuse already modelled robot cells and
   mechanisms of the Cosimir simulations stem in emergency-training. We
   will present an approach for graphical visualisation and simulation of
   fire. We will show how to get realistic impressions of fire using
   advanced particle-simulation and how to use the advantages of particles
   to trigger states in a modified cellular automata used for the
   simulation of fire-behaviour. By this we can have a simulated fire
   developing and reacting on other fires and different substances as
   water, CO2 or oxygen. It turns out that the mechanisms implemented for
   fire-simulation are also valuable for robot-simulation. So there is a
   mutual benefit between the robot-simulation and the simulation of fire.
   The methods proposed in this paper have been implemented and
   successfully tested on Cosimir, a commercial robot-and

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose. Recent evidence indicates that intensive massed
   practice may be necessary to modify neural organization and effect
   recovery of motor skills in patients following stroke. Virtual reality
   (VR) technology has the capability of creating ail interactive,
   motivating environment in which practice intensity and feedback can be
   manipulated to create individualized treatments to retrain movement.
   Case Description. Three patients (NIL, LE, and DK), who were in the
   chronic phase following stroke, participated in a 2-week training
   ;program (31/2, hours a day) including dexterity tasks oil real objects
   and VR exercises. The VR simulations were targeted for range of motion,
   movement speed, fractionation, and force production. Outcomes. NIL's
   function was the most impaired at the beginning of the intervention, but
   showed improvement in the thumb and fingers in range of motion and speed
   of movement, LE improved in fractionation and range of motion of his
   thumb and fingers. DK made the greatest gains, showing improvement in
   range of motion and strength of the thumb, velocity of the thumb and
   fingers, and fractionation. Two of the 3 patients improved on the Jebsen
   Test of Fland Function. Discussion. The outcomes suggest that VR may be
   useful to augment rehabilitation of the upper limb in patients in the
   chronic phase following stroke. {[}Merians AS,Jack D, Boian R, et al.

Abstract = {{In the past, the traditional training method of `hand to hand' teaching
   was adopted in industry. This method needs a long time and its
   efficiency is low, it is also affect the production and cannot keep up
   with the renewal of devices and equipments. Moreover may do harm to a
   practical system or devices and equipment. So it is necessary to have a
   new training method to carry out operation training. This is just the
   training simulator. In this paper, the introduction of training
   simulator about what is training simulator, why we use it, how it is
   done is presented. Moreover the container crane training simulator based
   on virtual reality and programmable logic control system (PLC) is
   introduced. In addition, the functions, working theory, composition and

Abstract = {{Recent advances in virtual reality (VR) and the increase in the power of
   modern computers has allowed for the rapid expansion of VR applications
   in industry. Virtual reality offers limitless possibilities in training,
   simulation and education. Although the minerals industry has been slow
   to invest in and use this advanced technology, the number of VR
   applications in the industry is increasing. VR has a great potential to
   increase productivity, better utilise time and most importantly improve
   safety awareness and therefore reduce incidents.
   The Advanced Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality in the Minerals
   Industry Research Unit (MineVR) at the University of Queensland, has
   recently been involved in developing VR applications for the minerals
   industry in conjunction with the various research centres. This paper
   describes the development of a VR training and simulation model of the
   CMTE's drill rig. The simulation will be used primarily in training
   operators, possible future developments include real-time production of
   results for given situations, and looking at linking the simulation to
   the actual drill in the laboratory. The simulation part of the model
   allows the user to turn the equipment on and off, operate it, and also
   identify some basic safety hazards that have been simulated around the
   rig.}},

Pages = {{393-419}},
Abstract = {{Organizational systems are complex systems, which are very dependent on
   the continuous supportive efforts of trained people. At the same time
   the complexity of these systems transcends the capacity of individual
   engineers or groups of engineers. The construction and operation of
   medium to large organizational systems therefore requires the use of
   advanced computerized aids. The intensity and importance of human
   activity in these systems implies that the computerized aids must help
   to integrate human factors into the system structure as well as helping
   to design the more traditional aspects such as information flow,
   logistics, physical production, databases and the like.
   Simulation models are very powerful, broad and flexible tools to this
   end if applied systematically during the Lifetime of the organizational
   system. An intuitive description of process oriented discrete event
   simulation is given for readers unfamiliar with this form of simulation
   modelling. The paper then continues with a description of how models of
   organizational systems can be organized, wherein human factors find a
   natural place within the virtual actors that represent human beings.
   Human factors in an organization have a most central concept, which is
   the human ability to construct mental models. Through utilization of
   mental models of different aspects of reality, employees are able to
   predict and influence future sequences of events. This imparts a sense
   of understanding of the situation or problem at hand. Mental models,
   which are constructed on the basis of knowledge and experience, are
   considered insightful and lead to actions, which are seen as
   constructive, skilful and productive. These mental models are called
   cognitive models since they are the result of the individual's total
   psychological and physiological condition. Well-made cognitive models
   are a precondition for success in learning and using technical systems
   as well as a prerequisite for achieving good social relations. Briefly,
   well-trimmed cognitive models spell success at work and in private life.
   Simulation models of organizational systems can form the basis of
   advanced computerized aids used in the design and operation of
   organizational systems. They are able to integrate human factors with
   information processing and with transport and refinement of material all
   in the same dynamic model. Such simulation models are in harmony with
   the natural thought processes used by humans, especially when they are
   dealing with complex systems.}},
