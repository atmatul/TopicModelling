Title = {{User Experience of Augmented Reality System for Astronaut's Manual Work
   Support}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces Augmented Reality (AR) system to support an
   astronaut's manual work, it has been developed in two phases. The first
   phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's (ESA) project called
   ``EdcAR-Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and
   Verification, and Operations{''} and the second phase was developed and
   evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project ``WEKIT-Wearable Experience
   for Knowledge Intensive Training.{''} The main aim is to create an AR
   based technological platform for high knowledge manual work support, in
   the aerospace industry with reasonable user experience. The AR system
   was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform, and it
   was implemented based on a modular architecture. The purpose of the
   evaluation of the AR system is to prove that reasonable user experience
   of augmented reality can reduce performance errors while executing a
   procedure, increase memorability, and improve cost, and time efficiency
   of the training. The main purpose of the first phase evaluation was to
   observe and get feedback from the AR system, from user experience
   point-of-view for the future development. The use case was a filter
   change in International Space Station (ISS)-Columbus mock-up in the
   ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC). The test group of 14 subjects it
   included an experienced astronaut, EAC trainers, other EAC personnel,
   and a student group. The second phase the experiment consisted of an
   in-situ trial and evaluation process. The augmented reality system was
   tested at ALTEC facilities in Turin, Italy, where 39 participants were
   performing an actual real astronaut's procedure, the installation of
   Temporary Stowage Rack (TSR) on a physical mock-up of an ISS module.
   User experience evaluation was assessed using comprehensive
   questionnaires, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their
   experience with a platform. This focused on technology acceptance,
   system usability, smart glasses user satisfaction, user interaction
   satisfaction, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their
   experience with a platform. The analysis of the questionnaires and
   interviews showed that the scores obtained for user experience,
   usability, user satisfaction, and technology acceptance were near the
   desired average. Specifically, The System Usability Scale (SUS) score
   was 68 indicating that the system usability is already nearly acceptable
   in the augmented reality platform.}},

Abstract = {{Motion capture acting is a challenging task, it requires trained and
   experienced actors who can highly rely on their acting and imagination
   skills to deliver believable performances. This is especially the case
   when preparation times are short and scenery needs to be imagined, as it
   is commonly the case for shoots in the gaming industry. To support
   actors in such cases, we developed a mixed reality application that
   allows showing digital scenery and triggering emotions while performing.
   In this paper we tested our hypothesis that a mixed reality head-mounted
   projection display can support motion capture acting through the help of
   experienced motion capture actors performing short acting scenes common
   for game productions. We evaluated our prototype with four motion
   capture actors and four motion capture experts. Both groups considered
   our application as helpful, especially as a rehearsal tool to prepare
   performances before capturing the motions in a studio. Actors and
   experts indicated that our application could reduce the time to prepare
   performances and supports the set up of physical acting scenery.}},

Abstract = {{Campylobacter contamination of chicken on sale in the UK remains at high
   levels and has a substantial public health impact. This has prompted the
   application of many interventions in the supply chain, including
   enhanced biosecurity measures on-farm. Catching and thinning are
   acknowledged as threats to the maintenance of good biosecurity, yet the
   people employed to undertake this critical work (i.e. `catchers') are a
   rarely studied group.
   This study uses a mixed methods approach to investigate catchers' (n
   =53) understanding of the biosecurity threats posed by the catching and
   thinning, and the barriers to good biosecurity practice. It interrogated
   the role of training in both the awareness and practice of good
   biosecurity. Awareness of lapses in biosecurity was assessed using a
   Watch-\&-Click hazard awareness survey (n =53). Qualitative interviews
   (n=49 catchers, 5 farm managers) explored the understanding, experience
   and practice of catching and biosecurity.
   All of the catchers who took part in the Watch-\&-Click study identified
   at least one of the biosecurity threats with 40\% detecting all of the
   hazards. Those who had undergone training were significantly more likely
   to identify specific biosecurity threats and have a higher awareness
   score overall (48\% compared to 9\%, p = 0.03). Crucially, the
   individual and group interviews revealed the tensions between the high
   levels of biosecurity awareness evident from the survey and the reality
   of the routine practice of catching and thinning. Time pressures and a
   lack of equipment rather than a lack of knowledge appear a more
   fundamental cause of catcher-related biosecurity lapses. Our results
   reveal that catchers find themselves in a `catch-22' situation in which
   mutually conflicting circumstances prevent simultaneous completion of
   their job and compliance with biosecurity standards.(3) Hence, although
   education about, and enforcement of, biosecurity protocols has been
   recommended, our findings suggest that further reforms, including
   changing the context in which catching occurs by improving the equipment
   and other resources available to catchers and providing more time for
   biosecurity, will be essential for successful implementation of existing
   biosecurity protocols. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{The evaluation of an elementary virtual training system for manual
   assembly}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{7496-7508}},
Abstract = {{Due to the low volume high variety strategies of manufacturing
   companies, manual assembly operators have a much larger cognitive load
   than before. The expertise of the operators must be kept up to date at
   any time. Since the high investment and low flexibility of a real
   setting to perform a manual assembly training, a virtual replica is
   introduced in many cases. The aim of this paper is to study the effect
   of an elementary virtual training for manual assembly tasks. In
   literature, different studies on the topic can be found; nevertheless, a
   comparison between the different studies is not possible due to diverse
   evaluation methods and descriptions. A benchmark for a uniform
   evaluation of virtual training systems is presented and applied to this
   experiment. Two groups were submitted to a number of manual assembly
   tasks. The test group got a virtual training period in advance. A
   significant learning transfer during that training period was observed.
   When the first assembly of the reference group is counted as a real
   training, no significant difference can be found between the virtual and
   real training. The outcomes of this experiment will be used in future
   work to compare different virtual training systems and influential
   factors such as the assembly complexity. Furthermore, the application of
   virtual training to manual assembly in a mixed-model environment and its
   industrial usability are topics that still need to be studied.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Apprenticeship training is at the heart of government skills policy
   worldwide. Application of cutting-edge information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) can enhance the quality of construction training,
   and help in attracting youth to an industry that traditionally has a
   poor image and slow in uptaking innovation. This paper reports on the
   development of a novel mixed reality (MR) system uniquely targeted for
   the training of construction trade workers, i.e.,skilled manual workers.
   From a general training viewpoint, the system aims to address the
   shortcomings of existing construction trades training, in particular the
   lack of solutions for enabling trainees to train in realistic and
   challenging site conditions, while eliminating occupational health and
   safety risks. From a technical viewpoint, the system currently
   integrates state-of-the-art virtual reality goggles with a novel
   cost-effective 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head pose tracking system
   supporting the movement of trainees in room-size spaces, as well as a
   game engine to effectively manage the generation of the views of the
   virtual three-dimensional environment projected on the VR goggles.
   Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the 6-DOF head pose
   tracking system, which is the main computational contribution of the
   research reported in this paper. Then, preliminary results reveal its
   value to enable trainees to experience construction site conditions,
   particularly being at height, in different settings. Details are
   provided regarding future work to extend the system into the envisioned
   full MR system whereby a trainee would be performing an actual task,
   e.g.,bricklaying, while being immersed in a virtual project environment.

Abstract = {{Due to the narrow space and complex structure of spacecraft cabin, the
   existing asssembly systems can not well suit for the assembly process of
   cabin products. This paper aims to introduce an assembly auxiliary
   system for cabin products. A hierarchical-classification method is
   proposed to re-adjust the initial assembly relationship of cabin into a
   new hierarchical structure for efficient assembly planning. An improved
   ant colony algorithm based on three assembly principles is established
   for searching a optimizational assembly sequence of cabin parts. A mixed
   reality assembly environment is constructed with enhanced information to
   promote interaction efficiency of assembly training and guidance. Based
   on the machine vision technology, the inspection of left redundant
   objects and measurement of parts distance in inner cabin are efficiently
   performed. The proposed system has been applied to the assembly work of
   a spacecraft cabin with 107 parts, which includes cabin assembly
   planning, assembly training and assembly quality inspection. The
   application result indicates that the proposed system can be an
   effective assistant tool to cabin assembly works and provide an
   intuitive and real assembly experience for workers. This paper presents
   an assembly auxiliary system for spacecraft cabin products, which can
   provide technical support to the spacecraft cabin assembly industry.}},

   Audience: Emerging the Nano-entertainment experience{''} {[}1], the
   author posited on how Inhabited Information Spaces, created as core
   catalyst of research, may be questioned as a multisensory future virtual
   work of art. This themed Human-Computer Interaction for Entertainment
   contribution for the EAI INTETAIN 2015 conference builds upon the
   earlier work by questioning meaning making from such self-active
   entertainment experiences. Contextually, self-active relates to actor
   empowerment via ICT, whilst entertainment refers to HCI paradigms that
   are fun, engaging, and enjoyable.
   Conceptualizing, designing and realizing alternative digital media
   entertainment situations in stage performance, interactive installations
   and exhibitions at leading Museums for Modern Art, National and
   International major events, contributed to development of a sensor-based
   system conceived as a platform to investigate meaning making having
   societal impact beyond art. The system involves arrays of selectable
   sensor profiles mixed and matched according to requirements. Sensing of
   human input can be through worn (biosignal e.g. EEG, ECG, EMG, GSR),
   held, and/or non-worn sensors (volumetric, linear and planar interface
   profiles). Mapping of sourced human data is to a variety of digital
   content including art-based (music making, digital painting, lighting
   effects), video games, Virtual Reality and robotic devices. System
   adaptability promotes participant profile matching e.g. according to
   desired outcome. All ages and abilities are potential users.

   This work highlights how co-informing paradigms between computer and

   impact as well as commercial patented product and industry start-ups. At
   the core of the research is a rethinking in the way a human interacts

Abstract = {{Electric Mobility is getting to be reality and Electric Vehicles and
   Hybrid Electric Vehicles are presently being created and marketed on an
   expansive scale. This has an enormous impact on all electrical and
   mechanical frameworks in a car, displaying new effectiveness, size,
   safety and expenditure challenges. This implies that new ideas must be
   produced at both component and system architectural levels. There is at
   present a pattern in the automotive industry to supplant combustion
   engines with electric motors or a mix of an electric motor and a
   combustion engine, thereby significantly decreasing the environmental
   impact of automobiles by diminishing (i.e., hybrids/crossovers) or
   totally eliminating (i.e., electric vehicles) car emissions. This switch
   in drive train innovation is not, on the other hand, without its
   technological hurdles as the utilization of an electric motor means the
   need for reasonably prized batteries with high energy densities, long
   operating lifetimes, and operable in a wide range of conditions.
   Additionally, it is imperative that the battery-pack of a vehicle pose
   no undue health threats, either during vehicle use or amid times of
   storage. A challenge in developing this technology included the
   extremely tight packaging space with transmission and motor to be
   packaged along with the power electronics control unit in the front of

Abstract = {{The ARCW and SERIO Projects deal with Health \& Safety during work at
   construction site. Modern IT technologies are used to achieve the
   highest standards. Since accident rate of such works is alarmingly high,
   ensuring safety while working at heights is crucial. Thus, this project
   is implementing proper quality and safety of works during assembly of
   curtain walls. It will be achieved by modern training materials with the
   use of Augmented Reality (AR, for ARCW project) and mobile devices (for
   SERIO project). AR is the term to define a direct or indirect view of
   the psychical environment in the real world, which elements combine with
   virtual elements in order to create a mixed reality in real time. AR
   will enable precise conduction of activities preformed by workers in an
   efficient manner, ensuring the safety of work at the same time. Some
   important aspects of the ARCW project are:
   Analysis of different kinds of curtain walls and select the most
   appropriate ones to implement the training system based on AR,
   Identify basics skills related to safe procedures of curtain walls
   assembly,
   Develop the software to establish the training design based on AR and
   the necessary hardware for its implementation,
   Organize a training pilot with curtain walls fitters in which the system
   will be tested.
   The European Directive 2001/45/EC, oblige to take appropriate measures
   to improve safety and health at work. Falls from height are the most
   common causes of serious accidents, often fatal. The implementation of
   the Directive is particularly important for facade works which will be
   main subject of the project. Hence, the products of the project and all
   activities related to it will contribute to decreasing number of fatal
   accidents on construction sites caused by falling from a height.
   The SERIO project - ``On-site construction employees' occupational
   safety in Europe the enhancement and strengthening of their Health and
   Safety skills development by means of the creation of multimedia
   training, based on case studies with the use of contemporary devices{''}
   (Project Number: 2013-1-PL1-LEO05-37526) - will develop a mobile
   application for Health and Safety rules. Consequently, project aims at
   developing good Health and Safety habits and behaviors in users. Hence,
   SERIO application would be used as an independent training tool or as a
   supplementary instrument during mandatory Health and Safety training, in
   order to provide non-formal learning by presenting H\&S issues in a more
   attractive and comprehensive manner for construction staff. The
   application will focus on messages based on graphics, pictures, signs
   and photographs etc., rather than concentrating on written text and
   definitions. This makes it more understandable and accessible for
   representatives of other countries who are not involved in the project.
   The SERIO project addresses the following objectives:
   Create an application allowing quick and easy understanding of Health
   and Safety issues,
   Elaborate a training methodology adapted for the application including
   e.g. pictures, voices, animations, and short movies,
   Improve Health and Safety practice on building sites across Europe,
   Enhance the mobility of the labour force in the European Union.
   The training contents that will be part of the SERIO application have
   been agreed and develop by experts in Health and Safety.}},

Abstract = {{The Project deals with Health \& Safety during work at construction
   site. Modern IT technologies are used to achieve the highest standards.
   Since accident rate of such works is alarmingly high, ensuring safety
   while working at heights is crucial. Thus, this project is implementing
   proper quality and safety of works during assembly of curtain walls. It
   will be achieved by modern training materials with the use of Augmented
   Reality (AR).
   AR is the term to define a direct or indirect view of the psychical
   environment in the real world, which elements combine with virtual
   elements in order to create a mixed reality in real time. AR will enable
   precise conduction of activities preformed by workers in an efficient
   manner, ensuring the safety of work at the same time.
   Some important aspects of the project are:
   The analysis of different kinds of curtain walls and select the most
   appropriate ones to implement the training system based on AR.
   The identification of basics skills related to safe procedures of
   curtain walls assembly.
   The development of the software to establish the training design based
   on AR and the necessary hardware for its implementation.
   The organization of a training pilot with curtain walls fitters in which
   the system will be tested
   The European Directive 2001/45/EC, oblige to take appropriate measures
   to improve safety and health at work. Falls from height are the most
   common causes of serious accidents, often fatal. The implementation of
   the Directive is particularly important for facade works which will be
   main subject of the project. Hence, the products of the project and all
   activities related to it will contribute to decreasing number of fatal
   accidents on construction sites caused by falling from a height.}},

Abstract = {{To effectively function in the workplace today, people must be
   proficient in their technical skills and must also be able to function
   as an effective team member. In the workplace they must work well with
   people of different disciplines and motivations. Universities have
   recognized this need and have adapted their curriculum to place
   additional emphasis on teaching the skills necessary to be an effective
   team member. Yet universities, constrained by their organizational
   structure and missions, cannot completely mimic the realities of the
   workplace business environment. Classes have a finite length and
   students quickly learn that any problem can be endured through the
   academic quarter instead of truly working out a sustainable solution.
   Teams composed of members with similar expertise are often willing to
   cover for the weaker team member due to the short team life which is
   usually measured in weeks. In teams with mixed expertise, grades earned
   are often based on a combination of individual/team effort versus solely
   on the team product. Faculty continually grapples with questions such as
   ``can a team member be fired{''} and ``if not, what are the realistic
   consequences?{''} School is a learning environment where student
   learning is fostered and students are given second chances. Academic
   culture, by its very nature, is opposed to unfairness, dire
   consequences, swift punishment and the harsh reality encountered in the
   world and specifically, the workplace. Considering these types of issues
   leads one to wonder how well the university education prepares a student
   to be successful in a real world team environment.
   This paper investigates this question through a comparison of university
   teams to business teams. Criteria for comparison includes team member
   motivations, level of commitment, technical competence, discipline, team
   moral and culture, and personality conflicts. Students participating on
   interdisciplinary teams as well as single-expertise teams were surveyed
   to determine their mastery of basic team skills. Recent California
   Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) graduates from
   Architectural Engineering, BioResource \& Agricultural Engineering, and
   Agricultural Systems Management programs were surveyed to determine the
   effectiveness of their teaming education in the business world. Industry
   Advisory Boards for these respective programs were surveyed to define
   the teaming expectations in the business world. Additionally, faculty
   with industry backgrounds were surveyed and questioned on the
   differences between the two environments.
   Problems with university culture that do little to expose students to
   the harsh realities of career expectations were identified and analyzed.
   Based on the results of these surveys and analysis of teams'
   performances, recommendations are presented to better shape the
   university process of enhancing development of effective teaming skills.}},

Abstract = {{In the construction industry, some progress have been achieved by
   researchers to design and implement environments for task training using
   VR technology and its derivatives such as Augmented and Mixed Reality.
   Although, these developments have been well recognized at the
   application level, however crucial to the virtual training system is the
   effective and reliable measurement of training performance of the
   particular skill and handling the experiment for long-run. It is known
   that motor skills cannot be measured directly, but only inferred by
   observing behaviour or performance measures. The typical way of
   measuring performance is through measuring task completion time and
   accuracy, but can be supported by indirect measurement of some other
   factors. In this paper, a virtual crane training system has been
   developed which can be controlled using control commands extracted from
   facial gestures and is capable to lift up loads/materials in the virtual
   construction sites. Then, we integrate affective computing concept into
   the conventional VR training platform for measuring the cognitive load
   and level of satisfaction during performance using human's forehead
   bioelectric-signals. By employing the affective measures and our novel
   control scheme, the designed interface could be adapted to user's
   affective status during the performance in real-time. This adaptable
   user interface approach helps the trainee to cope with the training for
   long-run performance, leads to gaining more expertise and provides more
   effective transfer of learning to other operation environments. The
   detailed methodology of the affective control is presented in the paper.
   The results and future applications of the proposed method for disabled
   users, especially from neck down are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

   several application domains from engineering to forensic science and

   augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality inside promising simulation
   tools for the training industry.
   Methods: Motivated by the requirement for superimposing anatomically
   correct 3D models on a human patient simulator (HPS) and visualizing
   them in an AR environment, the purpose of this research effort was to
   develop and validate a method for scaling a source human mandible to a
   target human mandible within a 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error.
   Results: Results show that, given a distance between 2 same landmarks on
   2 different mandibles, a relative scaling factor may be computed. Using
   this scaling factor, results show that a 3D virtual mandible model can
   be made morphometrically equivalent to a real target-specific mandible
   within a 1.30 mm RMS error.
   Conclusion: The virtual mandible may be further used as a reference
   target for registering other anatomic models, such as the lungs, on the
   HPS. Such registration will be made possible by physical constraints
   among the mandible and the spinal column in the horizontal normal rest
   position. (Sim Healthcare 3: 103-110, 2008)}},

Abstract = {{The European Union has set itself the daunting target of becoming the
   world's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010.
   Any hope of success against the United States and the Asian tiger
   economies lies in the quality of scientific and technological research.
   In France, postgraduate training has long labored under a deep
   academia/industry divide. Although the universities have introduced
   supervised 3-year doctoral courses along the lines of the
   English-speaking countries, they still produce too many postdocs with
   little experience or understanding of, and little taste for, the private
   sector. This ignores career realities : the public sector can offer
   employment to only half the postdocs it produces. The rest must fall
   back on positions in the private sector, in some cases with a sense of
   failure, ill suiting them to drive the intellectual economy forwards
   compared to their international competitors. To combat the divide and
   emphasize the quality of the research training available within
   industry, the public/private National Association for Technical Research
   (ANRT), acting on behalf of the Ministry of Research, created the
   Industrial Research Training Agreement (Cifre) scheme in 1981. Higher
   education laboratories and private companies combine to offer doctoral
   students the opportunity to undertake their 3-year course in a mixed
   public/private environment (the exact ratio is not defined but in the
   case of the Servier Research Group, an early and active participant in
   the scheme, at least one third of the course is spent in the private
   sector). The doctoral thesis is thereby transformed into a meaningful
   career qualification. Funded by the Ministry, with maintenance grants to
   the students and compensatory payments to the companies, the Cifre
   scheme, which is currently being expanded, has produced 12 000 postdocs
   personally and intellectually equipped for careers transiting seamlessly
   between the public and private sectors, to the enrichment of each.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal tourism is on the rise in Canada. The challenge is to develop
   products based on market research that utilize the existing
   infrastructure and knowledge in coastal communities. This paper
   therefore describes a new coastal fisheries tourism sector initiative
   designed to deliver specialized products that reflect the unique
   character of the fisheries industry. The need for this kind of tourism
   approach in fisheries has grown out of the decline of fishery stocks and
   the subsequent loss of fisheries-related employment in recent years.
   While the majority of initiatives associated with coastal fisheries
   tourism will incorporate. some notion of fisheries in their product mix,
   others may concentrate on cultural awareness of unique peoples,
   ecological, education or heritage tourism without references to
   fisheries. The vehicle for the sector is planned as land and water-based
   interpretive tours generally combined with accommodation facilities in
   communities along the coast. The paper presents the Fisheries Tourism
   Network, an ongoing initiative modeled on a cooperative approach to
   support the development of new tourism businesses that use the skills,
   experience and infrastructure of the fishing community. For the Network
   to establish credibility and expand effectively, it needs practical
   experience and valuable insights into the intricacies of coastal
   fisheries tourism planning and development. Four businesses in different
   stages of management have been incorporated as demonstration projects
   for this purpose.
   To facilitate the transition from fisheries to tourism, key components
   of training support and development need to be identified. These
   components include the role of the Network in responding to training
   needs, the elements of training and the specific instructional modules
   required to deliver the necessary products. The underlying rationale for
   training is to coordinate existing industry and tourism knowledge and
   channel it towards the development of responsible and viable coastal
   fisheries tourism products. As with other sectors, coastal fisheries
   tourism should develop according to the ecological, social and economic
   dimensions of sustainability. But more often than not, even best
   practices in tourism fall short of reconciling all three of these
   imperatives. If the Network can stimulate a reduction of pressure on the
   fisheries resource while practicing ecological responsibility combined
   with successful economic and social transition of workers from one
   sector into another, sustainable tourism can become a reality in this
   sector. Eventually, an emblem similar to an eco-label will become
   associated with responsible coastal fisheries tourism in British
   Columbia. Standards will reflect the diversity within the Network and
   marketing efforts will result in the tourist seeking out those
   operations displaying the emblem.
   This paper describes an approach for assessing international potential
   for coastal tourism and describes the latent demand from Germany using
   segmentation techniques catered to the long-haul pleasure travel market
   (Canadian Tourism Commission et al., 1996). It is based on the work by
   Williams et al. (1999), which analyzed the potential coastal market for
   long-haul travelers from the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada and
   identified their top travel characteristics. Segmentation is a method of
   market analysis where data is compiled as independent characteristics or
   variables and synthesized as demographic, behavioral or attitudinal
   segments (Fitzgibbon, 1994). From the approach taken in this analysis,
   the findings indicate that a travel affinity for coastal tourism
   products exists for approximately 59\% of the surveyed long-haul market
   in Germany. These potential coastal travelers felt that ``visiting
   remote coastal attractions like fishing villages or lighthouses{''} were
   often or always important to them when choosing their long-haul
   destination. In general, potential coastal travelers tend to be married
   baby boomers with no children that believe in getting value for their
   holiday money. They prefer destinations with outstanding scenery where
   they can appreciate ecological features in a friendly local environment.
   An aggressive strategy which creates scenic images of small towns and
   villages along the coast set in areas of rich biodiversity is needed to
   position the province as having the environment and infrastructure
   necessary to support product development in this sector. With singular
   focuses that can be marketed separately or as a package, British
   Columbia would be perceived as a top coastal destination by having
   unique features for each stretch of the coastline. Efforts should be
   focused on highlighting activities preferred by the German coastal
   traveler such as bird watching and other wildlife viewing opportunities
   as part of a product mix of learning about people, places and things.
   In conjunction with marketing information for coastal fisheries tourism,
   attention needs to be given to strategic actions in destination planning
   and product development, community involvement processes, and mechanisms
   of monitoring and assessment. While all coastal communities should have
   access to the eventual support services of the Network, decisions need
   to be made as to whether the immediate focus should be more on
   complementing existing tourism operations with displaced fishers or
   encouraging the start-tip of new businesses. Both are required, but in
   different proportions for different places. The Network also needs to
   create an understanding with communities in which they operate that
   their commitment to sustainable tourism means community control over
   expansion. Starting with the demonstration projects, the Network should
   organize a program where regular status reports are submitted by
   operators and random observations are taken of the operation. This sets
   the stage for a gradual and unobtrusive switch to checklists of
   operational standards and spot inspections after full membership has
   been awarded. With a focus on criteria such as these, standards for
   coastal fisheries tourism will develop with a systematic and practical
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{The bottleneck of the local loop in the telephone network (the so called
   last mile effect) is almost belonging to the past. As a matter of fact,
   the new ADSL techniques make now possible to give to each subscriber
   high bit rate access to INTERNET technique based services. These new
   possibilities of the network infrastructure are revolutionising the
   service content allowing the high bit rate videoservices to become
   reality not only for the happy few but for all. With the BATRU project
   and its offsprings, France Telecom and its partners are trialing with
   several hundreds of ADSL connected subscribers, pioneering commercial
   applications such as videobanking and videoshopping as well as
   applications related to social care such as ``videotutoring{''}. The
   facilities BATRU has put at the disposal of the subscribers and service
   providers are on the leading edge of the current technology. The BATRU
   communication sessions combine several communication components based on
   IP over ATM or native ATM : hypermedias documents (mixing text, static
   and animated images via various types of applets, VRML based 3D
   sequences, etc.), MPEG videosequences, high quality videophony and
   cooperative work tools between terminals.
   The BATRU approach is intended to foster a great variety of new services
   but which share some common features : they all rely on a high bit rate
   client-server organisation thence offering the possibility of on-line
   multimedia services and shared applications over the network) and make
   extensive use of the videotelephony. These services are accessible from
   public shopping centres or from homes.
   The high quality videotelephony used in BATRU opens the possibility to
   create between geographically distributed people almost the same sort of
   interpersonal links as between people dealing face to face. Therefore
   BATRU is paving the way to the development and expansion of a new
   generation of applications requiring ``rich{''} communication facilities
   in such fields as electronic commerce, industry (co-operative work in
   distributed corporations via INTRANET/EXTRANET), training and social
   care.
   As such the BATRU project and its followers, basing on the new broadband
   network facilities, clearly intend to open the way to the future
   possibility to carry out innovative commercial applications \&
   transactions between geographically distributed individuals where the
   human contact is of paramount importance and which up to now needed to
   be handled in face to face meetings.
   Very interesting and in some cases surprising results have been gathered
   on user reactions, on statistics about communication sessions and
   commercial transactions, on the advantages and drawbacks when using the
   new BATRU facilities for remote transactions as compared to transactions
   involving telephone or face to face communications. Real data taken from
   the running evaluation programme will be given about technical,
   commercial and social parameters. It is intended to show live
   demonstrations of the sort of described services on the France Telecom
   stand after the presentation.}},
