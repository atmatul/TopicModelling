Abstract = {{Augmented reality (AR) tools are poised to have great potential for
   organizations when it comes to complex processes in the field of
   industrial applications - like construction or maintenance in the
   automotive industry. The human-centred technology displays
   context-specific 3-D information in a real environment related to a
   specific targeted object. Immersive experiences are expected to boost
   task efficiency, the quality of training and maintenance purposes.
   However, ready-for-market AR tools are still rarely used and benefits
   seldom demonstrated. This paper focuses on the key performance
   indicators (KPIs) that are able to benchmark the impact of using
   ready-for-market AR tools on automotive maintenance performance. After a
   comprehensive literature review on the benefits of AR for several
   industrial applications in design, education and training, KPIs were
   extracted and evaluated by experts from the automotive industry. They
   were used in an empirical study - based on the technology acceptance
   model (TAM) - with users evaluating the KPIs before and after training
   situations. In addition, `Perceived Usefulness' and `Intention to Use'
   were investigated. Significant enhancements of all KPIs were observed
   and novice users were identified as a potential target group.}},

Title = {{User Experience of Augmented Reality System for Astronaut's Manual Work
   Support}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces Augmented Reality (AR) system to support an
   astronaut's manual work, it has been developed in two phases. The first
   phase was developed in Europeans Space Agency's (ESA) project called
   ``EdcAR-Augmented Reality for Assembly, Integration, Testing and
   Verification, and Operations{''} and the second phase was developed and
   evaluated within the Horizon 2020 project ``WEKIT-Wearable Experience
   for Knowledge Intensive Training.{''} The main aim is to create an AR
   based technological platform for high knowledge manual work support, in
   the aerospace industry with reasonable user experience. The AR system
   was designed for the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality platform, and it
   was implemented based on a modular architecture. The purpose of the
   evaluation of the AR system is to prove that reasonable user experience
   of augmented reality can reduce performance errors while executing a
   procedure, increase memorability, and improve cost, and time efficiency
   of the training. The main purpose of the first phase evaluation was to
   observe and get feedback from the AR system, from user experience
   point-of-view for the future development. The use case was a filter
   change in International Space Station (ISS)-Columbus mock-up in the
   ESA's European Astronaut Centre (EAC). The test group of 14 subjects it
   included an experienced astronaut, EAC trainers, other EAC personnel,
   and a student group. The second phase the experiment consisted of an
   in-situ trial and evaluation process. The augmented reality system was
   tested at ALTEC facilities in Turin, Italy, where 39 participants were
   performing an actual real astronaut's procedure, the installation of
   Temporary Stowage Rack (TSR) on a physical mock-up of an ISS module.
   User experience evaluation was assessed using comprehensive
   questionnaires, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their
   experience with a platform. This focused on technology acceptance,
   system usability, smart glasses user satisfaction, user interaction
   satisfaction, and interviews, gathering an in-depth feedback on their
   experience with a platform. The analysis of the questionnaires and
   interviews showed that the scores obtained for user experience,
   usability, user satisfaction, and technology acceptance were near the
   desired average. Specifically, The System Usability Scale (SUS) score
   was 68 indicating that the system usability is already nearly acceptable
   in the augmented reality platform.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1220-1226}},

Abstract = {{Food safety training does not always result in behavior change, perhaps
   because of flaws inherent in traditional training designs. New
   technologies such as augmented reality headsets or head-mounted action
   cameras could transform the way food safety training is conducted in the
   food industry. Training conducted with wearable technology presents
   visual content in the first-person or actor's perspective, as opposed to
   the traditional third-person or observer perspective. This visual
   hands-on first-person perspective may provide an effective way of
   conveying information and encouraging behavior execution because it uses
   the mirror neuron system. There is little published literature about the
   impact of perspective on food safety training outcomes, such as
   motivation. The present study included a repeated-measures design to
   determine how first- and third-person camera angles affected hand
   washing training reactions among 108 currently employed restaurant food
   handlers. Participants were assessed on their posttraining compliance
   intentions, compliance self-efficacy, perceived utility of the training,
   overall satisfaction with the training, and video perspective
   preference. A significant proportion of food handlers (64\%) preferred
   the first-person video perspective (z = 5.00, P < 0.001), and a
   significant correlation was found between compliance intentions and
   compliance self-efficacy (r(108) = 0.361, P < 0.001) for the
   first-person video. No significant differences in video preference were
   found for demographic variables, including age (chi(2) (2, n = 104) =
   1.69, P= 0.430), which suggests that the first-person training format
   appeals to a diverse workforce. These findings support the application
   of wearable technology to enhance hand washing training outcomes across
   a wide range of demographic groups. This research lays the framework for
   future studies to assess the impact of instructional design on
   compliance concerning hand washing and other food handling behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Construction is a high hazard industry which involves many factors that
   are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety has always been advocated
   by many construction companies, and they have been working hard to make
   sure their employees are protected from fatalities and injuries. With
   the advent of Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a
   witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
   applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing complex
   workplace situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and
   undergoing training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR
   applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover
   the related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper starts
   with a review and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR
   prototypes, products and the related training and evaluation paradigms.
   Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly journals,
   this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR
   technology characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and
   evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of technical
   features and types that could be implemented in the context of
   construction safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated,
   while significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS
   research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and identification,
   safety training and education, safety instruction and inspection, and so
   on. Last but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived
   from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research
   works. It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist

Abstract = {{As the Industry 4.0 takes shape, human operators experience an increased
   complexity of their daily tasks: they are required to be highly flexible
   and to demonstrate adaptive capabilities in a very dynamic working
   environment. It calls for tools and approaches that could be easily
   embedded into everyday practices and able to combine complex
   methodologies with high usability requirements. In this perspective, the
   proposed research work is focused on the design and development of a
   practical solution, called Sophos-MS, able to integrate augmented
   reality contents and intelligent tutoring systems with cutting-edge
   fruition technologies for operators' support in complex man-machine
   interactions. After establishing a reference methodological framework
   for the smart operator concept within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the
   proposed solution is presented, along with its functional and
   non-function requirements. Such requirements are fulfilled through a
   structured design strategy whose main outcomes include a multi-layered
   modular solution, Sophos-MS, that relies on Augmented Reality contents
   and on an intelligent personal digital assistant with vocal interaction
   capabilities. The proposed approach has been deployed and its training
   potentials have been investigated with field experiments. The
   experimental campaign results have been firstly checked to ensure their
   statistical relevance and then analytically assessed in order to show
   that the proposed solution has a real impact on operators' learning
   curves and can make the difference between who uses it and who does not.

Abstract = {{As today's oil and gas projects are becoming larger and more complex,
   project managers are constantly faced with a number of concerns about
   schedules, budgets, productivity and safety. Operating an oil and gas
   facility is a process where workers refer to technical specifications to
   obtain the right information, identify the components, and then make a
   decision as to the adjustment or correctness. This entire process is
   iterative and triggers a learning process which may lead to improved
   proficiency as the cycle is repeated. The inability to find the right
   information or sequence within a cycle can contribute to efficiency
   losses. Jobsite training offered by qualified organisations and
   associations for the oil and gas industry is very limited, and the
   relevant training facilities and centres that have been established or
   considered in the construction agenda are far from sufficient to the
   growing standard of operators and industry expansion. This paper,
   underpinned by advanced innovative visualisation technologies, proposes
   a framework to improve efficiency and expedite the process of developing
   the complex procedural skills in operating and maintaining oil and gas
   facilities, through identifying scientific principles of enabling
   complex procedural learning approaches, developing proficiency-based
   learning approaches and corresponding learning curricula, and appraising
   learning outcomes according to developed skillset taxonomy. The proposed
   framework is tested under the development of an innovative and immersive
   Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality training system, which reveals
   significantly pragmatic benefits in terms of boosting up workforce
   productivity while bringing down rework. It is also demonstrated that
   embedding paradigms of transformative learning process while
   pedagogically adopting Information Communication Technologies (ICT) in
   curricula development and assessment regimes can help the sector
   significantly improve workforce safety.}},

Abstract = {{Healthcare in general, and surgery/interventional care in particular, is
   evolving through rapid advances in technology and increasing complexity
   of care, with the goal of maximizing the quality and value of care.
   Whereas innovations in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies have
   driven past improvements in the quality of surgical care, future
   transformation in care will be enabled by data. Conventional
   methodologies, such as registry studies, are limited in their scope for
   discovery and research, extent and complexity of data, breadth of
   analytical techniques, and translation or integration of research
   findings into patient care. We foresee the emergence of
   surgical/interventional data science (SDS) as a key element to
   addressing these limitations and creating a sustainable path toward
   evidence-based improvement of interventional healthcare pathways. SDS
   will create tools to measure, model, and quantify the pathways or
   processes within the context of patient health states or outcomes and
   use information gained to inform healthcare decisions, guidelines, best
   practices, policy, and training, thereby improving the safety and
   quality of healthcare and its value. Data are pervasive throughout the
   surgical care pathway; thus, SDS can impact various aspects of care,
   including prevention, diagnosis, intervention, or postoperative
   recovery. The existing literature already provides preliminary results,
   suggesting how a data science approach to surgical decision-making could
   more accurately predict severe complications using complex data from
   preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative contexts, how it could
   support intraoperative decision-making using both existing knowledge and
   continuous data streams throughout the surgical care pathway, and how it
   could enable effective collaboration between human care providers and
   intelligent technologies. In addition, SDS is poised to play a central
   role in surgical education, for example, through objective assessments,
   automated virtual coaching, and robot-assisted active learning of
   surgical skill. However, the potential for transforming surgical care
   and training through SDS may only be realized through a cultural shift
   that not only institutionalizes technology to seamlessly capture data
   but also assimilates individuals with expertise in data science into
   clinical research teams. Furthermore, collaboration with industry
   partners from the inception of the discovery process promotes optimal
   design of data products as well as their efficient translation and
   commercialization. As surgery continues to evolve through advances in
   technology that enhance delivery of care, SDS represents a new knowledge
   domain to engineer surgical care of the future.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality and augmented reality are being increasingly used in the
   manufacturing field for different purposes. As a result, these
   technologies seem to have a very promising future in the manufacturing
   industry. However, most of the current applications are based on the use
   of expensive proprietary software packages (such as specific CAD
   modules). This work presents a methodology that helps programmers to
   build virtual and augmented reality systems, which is valid for a broad
   number of industrial plants. Differently to other approaches, ours is
   based on open technologies, most of them free of cost. The technologies
   proposed to build the virtual worlds are already mature at the
   entertainment industry. The presented approach opens new possibilities
   for creating virtual reality models aimed at two major directions: (1)
   pure simulation of real processes and products for different purposes
   (e.g. staff training; prototype designing; manufacturing optimization;
   marketing) and (2) teleoperation of real processes (e.g. in dangerous

Title = {{The application of augmented reality technologies for the improvement of

Abstract = {{In many branches of industry, occupational safety experts identified two
   main causes of worker injuries related to the usage of modern
   electro-mechanical machines and systems: inadequate training and
   insufficient work experience, and monotonicity of the tasks often
   performed repeatedly. In this paper, we present a system based on
   augmented reality (AR) technologies that can be useful in reducing these
   factors of risk at work and decreasing the error rate and preventing
   injuries. The system that is implemented on mobile devices is intended
   to project augmented reality instructions directly at the work place. A
   worker is led by the AR-system step by step through various work and
   safety procedures that should be performed. Each procedure consists of
   steps specified by a series of instructions accessed through an
   interactive checklist. To ensure the safeness, if a confirmation is
   missing because of a skipped, incompletely, or wrongly performed step of
   a procedure, the AR-system blocks further implementation of the
   procedure and returns the worker to the previous step until the correct
   actions are carried out. At the same time, interactive work with the
   checklist breaks the monotonicity of the job. The system is personalized
   according to skills of a worker by taking into account his professional
   training and work experience. Depending on that it is determined the
   amount of data to be displayed to a worker helping even less skilled
   workers to perform a task.
   As a case study, the proposed approach is implemented as an
   instructional and occupational safety system for work at a universal
   lathe, which is an element of many technological processes of Thermal
   Power Plant Ugljevik in the Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
   where this AR-system was experimentally implemented and verified. (C)

Abstract = {{Passengers have historically struggled to navigate through unfamiliar
   stations. Transport operators also have challenges to communicate to
   customers during occasions when disruption has occurred. Exchange of
   information between transportation-operators and passengers has
   typically relied on static information available at fixed locations.
   Modern technology allows much more focused and specific information to
   be generated and presented to an information-consumer. This paper
   presents a review of existing and future-concept wayfinding systems with
   varying technical requirements. This paper highlights the advantages and
   disadvantages of these technologies, where they currently sit with
   regards to concept maturity and uptake within the rail industry.
   Customers increasingly have smart-mobile devices and are keen to use
   these to aid their journeys. Passengers are increasingly used to having
   detailed information available on demand. To address these demands many
   passenger information systems are increasingly giving information not
   just on time-table information but on how heavily booked a train is or
   if there are anticipated delays. Digital maps are increasingly being
   used to guide passengers to the correct platform. These maps are often
   2D, but with 3D maps the more complex station layouts often encountered
   in major cities can be better explored. The emerging technology of
   augmented-reality also has a part to play in the guidance of passengers
   through their journeys. Regardless of the information systems deployed
   there are benefits to both parties; helping customers achieve a seamless
   experience will help reduce dwell times and improve station throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction:
   The digital economy is developing rapidly worldwide. Novel technological
   trends, such as cloud computing, mobile and social solutions offer a new
   range of opportunities for business services in the knowledge-based
   economy. One emerging digital technology which can offer a host of
   exciting and novel business opportunities is `Augmented Reality (AR)'.
   As it was already mentioned in 2010 (van Krevelen, Poelman) AR still has
   some distance to go before industries and the general public will accept
   it as a familiar user interface. However, this concept-rather than a
   type of technology-changed already our way to interact with computers
   and the educational paradigm (Hsin-Kai Wu et al., 2013), enhancing
   collaborative tasks, both face-to-face and remote tasks
   (Martin-Gutierrez et al., 2014) in students-digital natives-and also
   teachers.
   This paper presents an analysis of students and teachers needs regarding
   the Augmented Reality in technical disciplines, conducted between
   January-March 2015 in the Higher Education centers in Romania, Malta,
   Iceland and Lithuania.
   Research methods:
   To find the relevant needs for teachers, students and entrepreneurs, a
   cross-sectional multicenter survey was conducted in Romania, Lithuania,
   Malta and Iceland. The questionnaire included interests and perceived
   needs regarding the use of AR, as well as suggestions on appropriate
   training methods or key components. Participants are 354 undergraduate
   and graduate students willing to acquire entrepreneurial skills and
   young aspiring business entrepreneurs from the 4 countries mentioned
   before.
   Findings:
   From the 354 participants who answered the survey, only 105 (29,7\%) had
   previous knowledge of AR, and only 19 (5.4\%) actually had the chance of
   using it in a setting. Respondents indicated using AR in educational
   activities (IT classes, research projects, non-educational project
   etc.), video games, mobile applications or diverse applications.
   Participants who only knew about AR indicated various sources (school,
   projects, advertising etc.). Many of those were incidental, without
   being linked with a continuous activity. Expectancies of efficacy of are
   generally high, with lower rates in the knowledgeable group (34\% vs.
   52\%), showing broad positive attitudes toward new technologies. Almost
   half (45 of 105) of the knowledgeable respondents indicated a training
   including AR related topic, yet only 8 of them could specified further
   the type of training involved (basical/part of a former
   project/tutorials). Participants favor participation on AR training;
   suggestion on training curricula and delivery method (not exclusively
   online) are further presented.
   Conclusion:
   One third of the respondents indicated use or previous knowledge of AR
   in educational setting. Among them, some enthusiasm can be found in its
   implementation in their future activities - teaching, learning or
   entrepreneurial ones. Still, key issues about where and how the AR
   functionalities can be used are merely vaguely understood. Future
   intervention should acknowledge how much of the educational content may
   be enhanced using the AR, and to independently evaluate how much (if
   any) of added value can bring.}},

   dataset consists of images of left hands, which are flipped to generate
   right hand images, resulting in 6 different classes. Segmented hand
   regions and their classes are also provided with the dataset. Our model

   environment. Virtual learning environments can provide trainees with
   access to cost-prohibitive equipment in impossible locations. It can
   provide a space for students to explore problem spaces and test
   solutions without risk. Despite these successes, questions remain
   regarding the capabilities and limitations of current technology,
   particularly regarding the effectiveness of knowledge and skill
   acquisition in virtual reality. The process for developing effective
   educational training virtual environments begins with understanding the
   learning objectives, re-creation of the real-world task(s), and
   assessing user performance and learning. Each stage of the process
   presents unique challenges and opportunities.}},

Abstract = {{Manual work is a cornerstone of manufacturing, also for factories of
   Industry 4.0 era. Use cases of manual work regard the production of
   single item, customized assemblies, small batches. Several injuries can
   be caused or aggravated by manual handling activities at work. Moreover,
   the efficiency of the whole process can benefit from correct body
   posture, parts' visibility and accessibility. Finally, manual work is
   strongly human-centered and its performance is affected by the
   expertise, the level of knowledge, attitudes and belief of workers. In
   this. complex context where multiple factors such as Efficiency, Work
   Performance, Ergonomics and Safety relate each other to achieve a
   satisfactory smart industry, the paper proposes an innovative Tangible
   Augmented Reality platform to train and assist workers during the manual
   handling and assembly tasks necessary to produce consumer goods with
   high aesthetic qualities. The proposed platform is the result of the
   application of a multipath methodology to link health and safety
   elements, typologies of injuries, ergonomics factors and relative
   qualitative and quantitative assessment methods and ergonomics analysis
   tools. The TAR platform allows the worker to consult the assembly
   instructions in a simple and user friendly way and to be informed by
   potential risk of injuries by a real-time alert. Based on video mapping
   techniques, the TAR system superimposes the necessary digital contents
   on the physical model of the product while the operator is building it.}},

Abstract = {{The insufficiency in the number of skilled technicians becomes the main
   problem of many (not only industrial) companies in the Czech Republic
   and other EU countries. The seriousness of the situation is proved by
   the tendency to invest funds in the material equipment of schools,
   technical education and solutions that link theory with practice. It is
   necessary to realize that the future professionals are being prepared
   for the positions in fast-changing area of industry. The change is
   enhanced by the rapid evolution of technologies, i.e. the so-called
   Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). This concept was officially
   introduced at the 2013 Hannover Fair. The Fourth Industrial Revolution
   is a term describing cyber - physical systems, which bring radical
   changes in the production process.
   The overall development in the EU countries in recent years has shown
   that the working competences in many professions vary in comparison with
   the past. Current trends in the development of technologies tend to
   downsize or revise certain working specializations. Certain new
   specializations have been created in some areas with growing demand for
   skilled professionals, mainly in connection with IT systems. An example
   might be the development in car-repairs, where the competencies in
   electronics are becoming essential, especially with respect to the
   electro-mobility.
   This development leads to the corresponding changes in the system of
   technical vocational education at the national and international level.
   This article describes the main areas of impact of the innovation
   process on technical vocational education. The main sub-themes addressed
   are the following:
   Analysis of the competencies and skills of workers and technicians in
   smart factories.
   Induced changes in curriculum, introducing of new courses in vocational
   training.
   Induced changes in training of teachers of vocational subjects.
   Impact of robotics, automation and 3D technologies on technical
   training.
   Internet, virtual and augmented reality.
   The paper brings some results of the research that was focused on the
   readiness of the Czech vocational subject teachers for the upcoming the
   Fourth Industrial Revolution.}},

   glass cockpits into new directions. Among them is the virtual
   enhancement of cockpits by augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality

   displays, but opaque VR displays are of increasing interest also. This
   technology enables the pilot to use virtual instrumentation as an add-on
   to the real cockpit. Even a totally virtualized instrumentation is
   possible. Furthermore, VR technology allows the fast prototyping and
   pilot training in cockpit environments that are still in development
   before even a single real instrument is built. We show how commercial
   off-the-shelf VR hardware can be used to build a prototyping
   environment. We demonstrate advantages and challenges when using

Abstract = {{Virtual training systems deliver training within a virtual environment
   (VE) using virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) technologies.
   However, to be fully accepted as a valid tool for training within the

   systems to deliver effective and efficient training to the relevant
   users. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency
   of the first prototype of the virtual training system (VTS) developed
   within the VISTRA (Virtual Simulation and Training of Assembly and
   Service Processes in Digital Factories) project (FP7-ICT-285176), using
   real end users from the OPEL automotive plant in Russelsheim, Germany.
   Two separate and independent studies were employed that used objective
   and subjective methods of investigation to establish performance and
   usability measures. The objective results show that virtual training was
   effective in reducing error during task performance when compared to
   traditional training. The subjective results concluded that the opinions
   of the participants were mainly positive concerning the overall use of
   the VTS for assembly operation training; however, a number of issues

Abstract = {{Apprenticeship training is at the heart of government skills policy
   worldwide. Application of cutting-edge information and communication
   technologies (ICTs) can enhance the quality of construction training,
   and help in attracting youth to an industry that traditionally has a
   poor image and slow in uptaking innovation. This paper reports on the
   development of a novel mixed reality (MR) system uniquely targeted for
   the training of construction trade workers, i.e.,skilled manual workers.
   From a general training viewpoint, the system aims to address the
   shortcomings of existing construction trades training, in particular the
   lack of solutions for enabling trainees to train in realistic and
   challenging site conditions, while eliminating occupational health and
   safety risks. From a technical viewpoint, the system currently
   integrates state-of-the-art virtual reality goggles with a novel
   cost-effective 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) head pose tracking system
   supporting the movement of trainees in room-size spaces, as well as a
   game engine to effectively manage the generation of the views of the
   virtual three-dimensional environment projected on the VR goggles.
   Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the 6-DOF head pose
   tracking system, which is the main computational contribution of the
   research reported in this paper. Then, preliminary results reveal its
   value to enable trainees to experience construction site conditions,
   particularly being at height, in different settings. Details are
   provided regarding future work to extend the system into the envisioned
   full MR system whereby a trainee would be performing an actual task,
   e.g.,bricklaying, while being immersed in a virtual project environment.

Abstract = {{This paper reports a study which demonstrates the advantages of using
   virtual-reality-based systems for training automotive assembly tasks.
   Sixty participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three
   training experiences to learn a car service procedure: (1) observational
   training through video instruction; (2) an experiential virtual training
   and trial in a CAVE; and (3) an experiential virtual training and trial
   through a portable 3D interactive table. Results show that virtual
   trained participants, after the training, can remember significantly
   better (p < .05) the correct execution of the steps compared to
   video-trained trainees. No significant differences were identified
   between the experiential groups neither in terms of post-training
   performances nor in terms of proficiency, despite differences in the
   interaction devices. The relevance of the outcomes for the automotive
   fields and for the designers of virtual training applications are
   discussed in light of the outcomes, particularly that virtual training
   experienced through a portable device such as the interactive table can
   be effective, as can training performed in a CAVE. This suggests the
   possibility for automotive industries to invest in advanced portable
   hardware to deliver effectively long-distance programs of training for
   car service operators placed all over the world.}},

Abstract = {{Today, computer-based training is developing rapidly. The visual
   education is also quite commonly used in higher education as well as in
   primary and secondary education. The tablets, smart boards and computers
   constitute the basis of visual education. Visual education has many
   advantages, such as learning faster, memorability and in terms of paper
   expenses. The visual animations and presentations have become a very
   important material in higher education in recent years along with the
   development of computer technologies. The image processing has been
   proposed to improve instructiveness in higher education courses in the
   fields of Medicine, Engineering and Science. In the field of medicine,
   the image processing methods can be used to show the diseased regions in
   an easier way in many images such as CT and MR images {[}5]. In the
   fields of engineering, image processing can be used to improve images in
   visual courses in the fields such as Geology, Civil Mining engineering.
   In addition, it can be easily preferred and applied in the departments
   such as Chemistry, Biology and Geography in the field of Science. The
   unclarity of images used in courses leads to ambiguity.
   In this study, image processing based approaches have been developed to
   ensure more effective learning of the courses in higher education. Image
   processing is a technology which is used in many places in daily life.
   The image processing methods have become widespread along with the
   acceleration of computer technologies. Today, image processing is used
   in many environments such as education, health, defense industry and
   industrial areas. Successful results are obtained application areas such
   as fault diagnosis and condition monitoring using image processing
   methods. Today, the augmented reality which is commonly used in the
   field of education can further increase its contribution to the field of
   education by associating with image processing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Youth entrepreneurship is vital for creating employment and sustainable
   growth and has become a priority in the EU policy agenda, as a tool to
   combat unemployment and social exclusion as well as to stimulate
   innovation among young people. According to Eurostat, the youth
   unemployment rates are much higher than unemployment rates for all other
   ages. Particularly, unemployment rate among young people (18-24 years
   old) in March 2015 in Slovakia reached 26,5 \%, in Romania 21,7\% and in
   Greece 49,8\%. Besides the high unemployment rates, not only in
   mentioned countries, but also in many EU Member States, there is also
   evidence of shortage of skills in STEM (Science, Technology,
   Engineering, Mathematics) fields.
   This paper presents the VR4STEM (Virtual Reality for STEM
   Entrepreneurship Training) project, which aims to assist young people to
   gain entrepreneurship skill in STEM domain and the related ICT industry.
   The project's main aim is to offer an educational environment for
   teaching/learning STEM entrepreneurship aspects that will use advanced
   ICT-based educational methods, like 3D virtual reality based ones. This
   will lead to more attractive ways of teaching, through the Virtual 3D
   World that will be developed, and hence to more effective ICT-based
   teaching and training. The VR4STEM project will offer to young people
   the chance to improve understanding and skills on STEM entrepreneurship,
   through the use of augmented technologies and will contribute in
   improving the quality of learning.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the narrow space and complex structure of spacecraft cabin, the
   existing asssembly systems can not well suit for the assembly process of
   cabin products. This paper aims to introduce an assembly auxiliary
   system for cabin products. A hierarchical-classification method is
   proposed to re-adjust the initial assembly relationship of cabin into a
   new hierarchical structure for efficient assembly planning. An improved
   ant colony algorithm based on three assembly principles is established
   for searching a optimizational assembly sequence of cabin parts. A mixed
   reality assembly environment is constructed with enhanced information to
   promote interaction efficiency of assembly training and guidance. Based
   on the machine vision technology, the inspection of left redundant
   objects and measurement of parts distance in inner cabin are efficiently
   performed. The proposed system has been applied to the assembly work of
   a spacecraft cabin with 107 parts, which includes cabin assembly
   planning, assembly training and assembly quality inspection. The
   application result indicates that the proposed system can be an
   effective assistant tool to cabin assembly works and provide an
   intuitive and real assembly experience for workers. This paper presents
   an assembly auxiliary system for spacecraft cabin products, which can
   provide technical support to the spacecraft cabin assembly industry.}},

Abstract = {{In order for a project to be satisfactory to end-users and completed
   with high quality, the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC)
   industry heavily relies on digital modeling, simulation and visual
   communication. In the past two decades, the AEC community has examined
   different approaches, including virtual and augmented reality, to
   improve communication, visualization, and coordination among different
   project participants; yet these approaches are slowly being adopted by
   the industry. Such technological advancements have the potential to
   improve and revolutionize the current approaches in design (e.g., by
   involving end-user feedback to ensure higher performing building
   operations and end-user satisfaction), in construction (e.g., by
   improving safety through virtual training), and in operations (e.g., by
   visualizing real-time sensor data to improve diagnostics). The authors'
   research vision builds upon the value of using immersive virtual
   environments (IVEs) during the design, construction, and operation
   phases of AEC projects. IVEs could provide a sense of presence found in
   physical mock-ups and make evaluation of an increased set of potential
   design alternatives possible in a timely and cost-efficient manner. Yet,
   in order to use IVEs during the design, construction, and operation
   phases of buildings, it is important to ensure that the data collected
   and analyzed in such environments represent physical environments. To
   test whether IVEs are adequate representations of physical environments
   and to measure user performance in such environments, this paper
   presents results from an experiment that investigates user performance
   on a set of everyday office-related activities (e.g., reading text and
   identifying objects in an office environment) and benchmarks the
   participants' performance in a similar physical environment. Sense of
   presence is also measured within an IVE through a set of questionnaires.
   By analyzing the experimental data from 112 participants, the authors
   concluded that the participants perform similarly in an NE setting as
   they do in the benchmarked physical environment for all of the measured
   tasks. The questionnaire data show that the participants felt a strong
   sense of presence within an NE. Based on the experimental data, the
   authors thus demonstrate that an NE can be an effective tool in the
   design phase of AEC projects in order to acquire end-user performance
   feedback, which might lead to higher performing infrastructure design
   and end-user satisfaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Skills needed for critical manual welding operations typically require a

   envision an innovative augmented reality welder training system to help
   accelerate the welder training process, in which an unskilled welder
   perceives the weld pool image with an auxiliary visual signal (arrow
   with direction and amplitude) superimposed upon, and makes speed
   adjustment accordingly. A critical part of the envisioned training
   system is to determine the optimal welding speed for an unskilled welder
   to follow. This paper aims to establish a machine algorithm calculating
   the optimal welding speed given a 3D weld pool surface, referred to as
   ``super welder.{''} To this end, dynamic experiments were conducted to
   model 3D weld pool surface characteristic parameters in response to the
   welding speed. A model-based predictive control (MPC) algorithm is
   proposed to maintain 3D weld pool surface characteristic parameters at
   desired values. The proposed super welder can also be directly utilized
   to control 3D Weld pool surface in automated welding. To demonstrate its
   performance, automated welding experiments are conducted for pipe GTAW.

Abstract = {{Providing relevant information at the right time in the right place is
   the major challenge in augmented reality, especially when it is applied
   in industry related applications. Indeed, by superimposing virtual
   elements on images which capture the real scene, augmented reality has
   proved its potential and maturity for facilitating maintenance
   activities, especially in training, repairing or inspections. In this
   system, instructions for an assembly or disassembly actions are linearly
   displayed to users and triggered sequentially and manually by the
   operator once he has completed each individual step.
   In this paper, we explore a metric which will allow the system to
   determine automatically when two objects are assembled since it provides
   hints on the current step of the maintenance scenario. This metric is
   based on pose estimations and reprojection errors by considering that
   the two objects are independent. The first results obtained on both
   synthetic and real image sequences show that this metric is efficient in
   detecting assembly/disassembly instants. We also lend guidelines on how
   to integrate this metric in a bigger computer vision system designed

Abstract = {{As a result of the demographic change-especially in Europe-companies are
   facing challenges to retain the employees' empirical knowledge within
   the company. In addition to that, continuous learning is required in
   many working areas to be able to deal with constant technological
   improvements. This is especially important for companies in the
   high-tech sector, in which employees are dealing with state of the art
   technologies. As an example, employees in industrial production
   facilities (like in the car industry) need to improve their skills
   whenever new components are added to the manufacturing process.
   Therefore, they can hugely benefit from learning on the job.
   Learning on the job while working in a production facility allows
   employees to extend their knowledge at the same time and at their
   current location when they require it. This usually takes place in a
   situational context, i.e. the context of the learner is related to the
   learning content. An example for situated learning on the job in
   manufacturing is an industrial mechanic who looks up instructions for
   the next production step. In contrast to off-the-job training the
   learning content is adjusted to the learner's current context.
   Augmented reality learning is one solution which can be used to enable
   situated learning on the job. This can be achieved by the use of
   wearable computers (wearables). As wearables are worn by the user and as
   such portable, always operational and allow a hands-free use, they can
   be used by employees in many situations when learning content is
   required. Furthermore, wearables can analyze the environment and its'
   surrounding context using build-in sensors (like GPS and Bluetooth for
   localization or image sensors for pattern matching) to provide
   situational learning content. This could even be done proactively, i.e.
   the wearable notifies the employee about relevant learning materials on
   its own.
   The main goal of this paper is to determine how learning in
   manufacturing companies can be supported using augmented reality
   learning on wearables. Therefore, we will first focus on identifying
   application scenarios in industrial production facilities which can
   benefit from using augmented reality learning to enhance the employees'
   skills on the job. Besides the identification of scenarios, we present a
   prototype for smart glasses which is targeted at employees in industrial
   production facilities for supporting learning on the job. It can be used
   for displaying learning content which is linked to real objects or
   locations using Bluetooth low energy. The prototype is developed for
   running natively on Google Glass.
   The results of this paper-the identified applications scenarios and the
   developed prototype-can be used as a basis for further research and for
   developing and deploying augmented reality learning applications in
   companies.}},

Abstract = {{The ARCW and SERIO Projects deal with Health \& Safety during work at
   construction site. Modern IT technologies are used to achieve the
   highest standards. Since accident rate of such works is alarmingly high,
   ensuring safety while working at heights is crucial. Thus, this project
   is implementing proper quality and safety of works during assembly of
   curtain walls. It will be achieved by modern training materials with the
   use of Augmented Reality (AR, for ARCW project) and mobile devices (for
   SERIO project). AR is the term to define a direct or indirect view of
   the psychical environment in the real world, which elements combine with
   virtual elements in order to create a mixed reality in real time. AR
   will enable precise conduction of activities preformed by workers in an
   efficient manner, ensuring the safety of work at the same time. Some
   important aspects of the ARCW project are:
   Analysis of different kinds of curtain walls and select the most
   appropriate ones to implement the training system based on AR,
   Identify basics skills related to safe procedures of curtain walls
   assembly,
   Develop the software to establish the training design based on AR and
   the necessary hardware for its implementation,
   Organize a training pilot with curtain walls fitters in which the system
   will be tested.
   The European Directive 2001/45/EC, oblige to take appropriate measures
   to improve safety and health at work. Falls from height are the most
   common causes of serious accidents, often fatal. The implementation of
   the Directive is particularly important for facade works which will be
   main subject of the project. Hence, the products of the project and all
   activities related to it will contribute to decreasing number of fatal
   accidents on construction sites caused by falling from a height.
   The SERIO project - ``On-site construction employees' occupational
   safety in Europe the enhancement and strengthening of their Health and
   Safety skills development by means of the creation of multimedia
   training, based on case studies with the use of contemporary devices{''}
   (Project Number: 2013-1-PL1-LEO05-37526) - will develop a mobile
   application for Health and Safety rules. Consequently, project aims at
   developing good Health and Safety habits and behaviors in users. Hence,
   SERIO application would be used as an independent training tool or as a
   supplementary instrument during mandatory Health and Safety training, in
   order to provide non-formal learning by presenting H\&S issues in a more
   attractive and comprehensive manner for construction staff. The
   application will focus on messages based on graphics, pictures, signs
   and photographs etc., rather than concentrating on written text and
   definitions. This makes it more understandable and accessible for
   representatives of other countries who are not involved in the project.
   The SERIO project addresses the following objectives:
   Create an application allowing quick and easy understanding of Health
   and Safety issues,
   Elaborate a training methodology adapted for the application including
   e.g. pictures, voices, animations, and short movies,
   Improve Health and Safety practice on building sites across Europe,
   Enhance the mobility of the labour force in the European Union.
   The training contents that will be part of the SERIO application have
   been agreed and develop by experts in Health and Safety.}},

Abstract = {{Today there is a big and increasing skills gap for qualified
   professionals both in emerging countries and advanced economies like
   USA, which is becoming a huge problem affecting industry productivity.
   Plenty of professional qualifications like welding, depend on the
   practical training effective time. When this skills training is
   difficult to arrange, dangerous, expensive, unhealthy and
   environmentally harmful, our Augmented Training Technology is really
   worth to attract young people, optimize the training resources and
   prepare students before they face the real practice scenario at
   workshops. We can help train more people, in less time, better
   qualified, safer, reducing costs and environmental impact and promoting
   women participation to traditionally male industries.
   Our vision is create innovative educational game based experiences,
   letting youth play, learn, grow, squeezing human talent potential for a
   happier world. We can help educational institutions attract more young
   people including women to industry careers from early ages, and train
   them safely, locally, more efficiently, increasing their employability
   and the industry competitiveness.
   We deliver an Educational Resources Management Platform (ERMP) called
   Augmented Training: Pioneer technology solution (the only one in the
   market) combining 4D Augmented Reality, real time advanced immersive
   simulation, e-learning, teacher management and monitoring software and
   apps for smart phones to enhance educational experiences and training
   results for institutions and industries worldwide.
   SOLDAMATIC for Welding training is the first commercial application of
   our Augmented Training Technology because it is very horizontal to many
   industries (Oil\&Gas, Infrastructure, Automotive, Energy, Aeronautics,
   Naval, Mining, etc.) and there is a huge skilled welder shortage almost
   in any country in the world, from emerging economies to USA, where more
   than 300.000 new welders will be required till 2020.

Abstract = {{To ensure a self-consistent scaling approximation, the underlying
   microscopic fluctuation components can naturally influence macroscopic
   means, which may give rise to emergent observable phenomena. In this
   paper, we describe a consistent macroscopic (cm-scale), mesoscopic
   (micron-scale), and microscopic (nano-scale) approach to introduce
   Telescopic Multi-Resolution (TMR) into current Augmented Reality (AR)
   visualization technology. We propose to couple TMR-AR by introducing an
   energy-matter interaction engine framework that is based on known
   Physics, Biology, Chemistry principles. An immediate payoff of TMR-AR is
   a self-consistent approximation of the interaction between microscopic
   observables and their direct effect on the macroscopic system that is
   driven by real-world measurements. Such an interdisciplinary approach
   enables us to achieve more than multiple scale, telescopic visualization
   of real and virtual information but also conducting thought experiments
   through AR. As a result of the consistency, this framework allows us to
   explore a large dimensionality parameter space of measured and
   unmeasured regions. Towards this direction, we explore how to build
   learnable libraries of biological, physical, and chemical mechanisms.
   Fusing analytical sensors with TMR-AR libraries provides a robust
   framework to optimize testing and evaluation through data-driven or
   virtual synthetic simulations. Visualizing mechanisms of interactions
   requires identification of observable image features that can indicate
   the presence of information in multiple spatial and temporal scales of
   analog data. The AR methodology was originally developed to enhance
   pilot-training as well as `make believe' entertainment industries in a
   user-friendly digital environment We believe TMR-AR can someday help us
   conduct thought experiments scientifically, to be pedagogically
   visualized in a zoom-in-and-out, consistent, multi-scale approximations.}},

   Since accident rate of such works is alarmingly high, ensuring safety
   while working at heights is crucial. Thus, this project is implementing
   proper quality and safety of works during assembly of curtain walls. It
   will be achieved by modern training materials with the use of Augmented

   AR is the term to define a direct or indirect view of the psychical
   environment in the real world, which elements combine with virtual
   elements in order to create a mixed reality in real time. AR will enable
   precise conduction of activities preformed by workers in an efficient
   manner, ensuring the safety of work at the same time.
   Some important aspects of the project are:
   The analysis of different kinds of curtain walls and select the most
   appropriate ones to implement the training system based on AR.
   The identification of basics skills related to safe procedures of
   curtain walls assembly.
   The development of the software to establish the training design based
   on AR and the necessary hardware for its implementation.
   The organization of a training pilot with curtain walls fitters in which
   the system will be tested
   The European Directive 2001/45/EC, oblige to take appropriate measures
   to improve safety and health at work. Falls from height are the most
   common causes of serious accidents, often fatal. The implementation of
   the Directive is particularly important for facade works which will be
   main subject of the project. Hence, the products of the project and all
   activities related to it will contribute to decreasing number of fatal
   accidents on construction sites caused by falling from a height.}},

Abstract = {{Training technicians to acquire new maintenance and assembly skills is
   important for various industries. Because maintenance and assembly tasks
   can be very complex, training technicians to efficiently perform new
   skills is challenging. Training of this type can be supported by
   Augmented Reality, a powerful industrial training technology that
   directly links instructions on how to perform the service tasks to the
   machine parts that require processing. Because of the increasing
   complexity of maintenance tasks, it is not sufficient to train the
   technicians in task execution. Instead, technicians must be trained in
   the underlying skills sensorimotor and cognitive that are necessary for
   the efficient acquisition and performance of new maintenance operations.
   These facts illustrate the need for efficient training systems for
   maintenance and assembly skills that accelerate the technicians'
   acquisition of new maintenance procedures. Furthermore, these systems
   should improve the adjustment of the training process for new training
   scenarios and enable the reuse of worthwhile existing training material.
   In this context, we have developed a novel concept and platform for
   multimodal Augmented Reality-based training of maintenance and assembly
   skills, which includes sub-skill training and the evaluation of the
   training system. Because procedural skills are considered as the most
   important skills for maintenance and assembly operations, we focus on
   these skills and the appropriate methods for improving them. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Effective applied research is based on close collaboration between
   research and industry, which, taking the findings of basic research on

Abstract = {{The process of troubleshooting an aircraft engine requires highly
   skilled and trained personnel who must be able to respond effectively to
   any circumstance; therefore, new methods of training to accelerate the
   cognitive processes of technicians must be integrated in the industry.
   In this matter the Augmented Reality technology represents an innovative
   tool that can ensure the efficient and correct transfer of knowledge.
   The numbers of errors during maintenance tasks can be reduced, AR
   provides information that is generally not easily available during
   maintenance operations because, in general, the troubleshooting process
   for airplane engine is a highly complex task and the diagnosis of a
   failure is critical for the passengers' safety. This research focuses on
   training and execution of tasks where an aviation technician must be
   familiarized with a wide variety of technical data, physical components
   of mechanical systems and the regulations that must be followed to
   release an airplane for flight, the specialist must develop a correct
   mind map of the system and should be able to troubleshoot if necessary.
   The case of study is the 737 Engine Bleed Air System that is designed to
   provide engine compressed air to air conditioning pack with the purpose
   of air pressurization during flight; engine air from the compressor is
   used, from the 5 degrees and the 9 degrees stage in a safe an economical
   way, knowledge of the correct function of the components will increase
   safety and considerably reduce cost of maintenance operations. The
   purpose of the investigation was to develop an ergonomic tool than
   improves the cognitive process of technician during training for the
   troubleshooting techniques of the aircraft, but it also can be used to
   the everyday task by capturing the know-how and helpful tips from more
   experienced operators. A mobile solution that functions on regular
   tablets was delivered to enhance the troubleshooting techniques and
   maintenance procedures of the Engine Air Bleed System, the software can
   function on two aspects for training and in situ operations. A
   commercial aeronautical training kit was used to validate the Fault
   Isolation Software; the results showed that the augmented reality
   technique takes 17\% less time and a quality increment of 24\% for this
   complex assembly system. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Europe are interested in
   finding new methods of training and workplace learning.
   Technology-enhanced practices of peer-to-peer learning may offer various
   new possibilities for SMEs. In this study we consider emerging
   technologies for informal learning in construction work. These
   technologies include wearable computing, invisible and ambient
   computing, augmented reality and novel interaction technologies. Three
   preliminary scenarios presented in this paper demonstrate how these
   technologies may be used. These scenarios have been developed, with a
   focus on the use of technology within a community supporting
   peer-to-peer learning, that may negate some of the social concerns of
   wearable and ubiquitous technologies. The inclusion of the construction
   workers in the design process, combined with smart design, is expected
   to find acceptable and fair solutions. It remains to be seen whether
   construction industry work communities will support this assertion.}},

Abstract = {{Augmented Reality (AR) is a particularly fascinating field due to its
   innovative technology that allows a person to experience the sensation
   of living in a computer-generated environment. AR integrates Virtual
   Reality (VR) into the real-world, enhancing the users experience with
   the objects surrounding them in real-time. A state-of-the-art technique
   is presented in this paper, implemented by students in the Business
   Incubator from Tecnologico de Monterrey with the collaboration of
   experts and supported by the Research Chair at Campus Monterrey.
   This paper presents an interactive instructions manual using AR, which
   will guide the user through the assembly or disassembly of a car engine.
   The use of augmented reality in manufacturing activities, especially in
   the automotive industry, increases the productivity by the simulation of
   parts undergoing their manufacturing process, reducing the need to
   create physical prototypes. This article describes the way entrepreneurs
   explore new technologies, using the resources available at the R\&D
   department, to develop an AR system for the assembly of a monobloc
   engine. A bright future is perceived for life enhancing AR systems.
   Industrial applications could vary from engine systems, as presented in
   this paper, to medical or aerospace training programs, imagination is

   minimize costs for specialized content generation.
   We present a general, customisable application framework, allowing to
   employ AR and VR techniques in order to support technicians in their

   existing support systems such as traditional manuals. Instead we
   integrate well-known AR- and novel presentation techniques with existing

Abstract = {{In the construction industry, some progress have been achieved by
   researchers to design and implement environments for task training using
   VR technology and its derivatives such as Augmented and Mixed Reality.
   Although, these developments have been well recognized at the
   application level, however crucial to the virtual training system is the
   effective and reliable measurement of training performance of the
   particular skill and handling the experiment for long-run. It is known
   that motor skills cannot be measured directly, but only inferred by
   observing behaviour or performance measures. The typical way of
   measuring performance is through measuring task completion time and
   accuracy, but can be supported by indirect measurement of some other
   factors. In this paper, a virtual crane training system has been
   developed which can be controlled using control commands extracted from
   facial gestures and is capable to lift up loads/materials in the virtual
   construction sites. Then, we integrate affective computing concept into
   the conventional VR training platform for measuring the cognitive load
   and level of satisfaction during performance using human's forehead
   bioelectric-signals. By employing the affective measures and our novel
   control scheme, the designed interface could be adapted to user's
   affective status during the performance in real-time. This adaptable
   user interface approach helps the trainee to cope with the training for
   long-run performance, leads to gaining more expertise and provides more
   effective transfer of learning to other operation environments. The
   detailed methodology of the affective control is presented in the paper.
   The results and future applications of the proposed method for disabled
   users, especially from neck down are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{As industrial plants and factories age, their maintenance requirements
   increase. Because maintenance mistakes directly increase the operating
   costs of a power plant, maintenance quality is significant concern to
   plant management. By law, all personnel working with nuclear technology
   must be re-trained every three years in Korea; however, as the
   statistical data show, the number of shutdown accidents at nuclear power
   plants (NPPs) due to maintenance failure is still high and needs to be
   reduced. Industries have started to adopt various technologies to
   increase the speed and accuracy of maintenance. Among those
   technologies, augmented reality (AR) is the latest multimedia
   presentation technology to be applied to plant maintenance, and it
   offers superior intuitiveness and user interactivity over other
   conventional multimedia. This empirical study aims to measure the
   optimum amounts of information to be delivered at a time and to identify
   what types of information enhance the learning ability of novices and to
   suggest heuristic guidelines by which to make effective AR training
   instructions. In the first experiment, the optimum amount of information
   in an AR learning environment for novices was found to be 4-5 pieces of
   information in a chunk by comparing results between a pre-test and an
   after-test. This result implies that intentionally made chunks help
   novices learn more effectively. In the second experiment, the AR
   training instruction based on the suggested heuristic guidelines was
   slightly more effective than other AR training instructions. Maintenance
   in nuclear power plants can be more reliable and accurate by training
   through AR training instruction based on the suggested heuristic

Abstract = {{Computer numerical control (CNC) simulation systems based on 3D graphics
   have been well researched and developed for NC tool path verification
   and optimization. Although widely used in the manufacturing industries,
   these CNC simulation systems are usually software-centric rather than
   machine tool-centric. The user has to adjust himself from the 3D graphic
   environment to the real machining environment. Augmented reality (AR) is
   a technology that supplements a real world with virtual information,
   where virtual information is augmented on to real objects. This paper
   builds on previous works of integrating the AR technology with a CNC
   machining environment using tracking and registration methodologies,
   with an emphasis on in situ simulation. Specifically configured for a
   3-axis CNC machine, a multi-regional computation scheme is proposed to
   render a cutting simulation between a real cutter and a virtual
   workpiece, which can be conducted in situ to provide the machinist with
   a familiar and comprehensive environment. A hybrid tracking method and
   an NC code-adaptive cutter registration method are proposed and
   validated with experimental results. The experiments conducted show that
   this in situ simulation system can enhance the operator's understanding
   and inspection of the machining process as the simulations are performed
   on real machines. The potential application of the proposed system is in
   training and machining simulation before performing actual machining

   to kinematics and physics based modeling is being used in virtual worlds
   to make them ``behave realistically{''}, on the other hand, those

Abstract = {{Introduction: Simulation and modeling represent promising tools for
   several application domains from engineering to forensic science and
   medicine. Advances in 3D imaging technology convey paradigms such as
   augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality inside promising simulation
   tools for the training industry.
   Methods: Motivated by the requirement for superimposing anatomically
   correct 3D models on a human patient simulator (HPS) and visualizing
   them in an AR environment, the purpose of this research effort was to
   develop and validate a method for scaling a source human mandible to a
   target human mandible within a 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error.
   Results: Results show that, given a distance between 2 same landmarks on
   2 different mandibles, a relative scaling factor may be computed. Using
   this scaling factor, results show that a 3D virtual mandible model can
   be made morphometrically equivalent to a real target-specific mandible
   within a 1.30 mm RMS error.
   Conclusion: The virtual mandible may be further used as a reference
   target for registering other anatomic models, such as the lungs, on the
   HPS. Such registration will be made possible by physical constraints
   among the mandible and the spinal column in the horizontal normal rest
   position. (Sim Healthcare 3: 103-110, 2008)}},

Abstract = {{This article examines several new and exciting communication
   technologies. Many of the technologies were developed by the
   entertainment industry; however, other industries are adopting and
   modifying them for their own needs. These new technologies allow people
   to collaborate across distance and time and to learn in simulated work
   contexts. The article explores the potential utility of these
   technologies for advancing laboratory animal care and use through better
   education and training. Descriptions include emerging technologies such
   as augmented reality and multi-user virtual environments, which offer
   new approaches with different capabilities. Augmented reality
   interfaces, characterized by the use of handheld computers to infuse the
   virtual world into the real one, result in deeply immersive simulations.
   In these simulations, users can access virtual resources and communicate
   with real and virtual participants. Multi-user virtual environments
   enable multiple participants to simultaneously access computer-based
   three-dimensional virtual spaces, called ``worlds,{''} and to interact
   with digital tools. They allow for authentic experiences that promote
   collaboration, mentoring, and communication. Because individuals may
   learn or train differently, it is advantageous to combine the
   capabilities of these technologies and applications with more
   traditional methods to increase the number of students who are served by
   using current methods alone. The use of these technologies in animal
   care and use programs can create detailed training and education
   environments that allow students to learn the procedures more
   effectively, teachers to assess their progress more objectively, and
   researchers to gain insights into animal care.}},

Abstract = {{The aircraft maintenance industry is a complex system consisting of
   several interrelated human and machine components. The linchpin of this
   system, however, is the human. Recognizing this, the Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA) has pursued human factors related research. In the
   maintenance arena the research has focused on the aircraft inspection
   process and the aircraft inspector. Training has been identified as the
   primary intervention strategy to improve the quality and reliability of
   aircraft inspection. In response to this need, the paper outlines the
   development of a binocular eye tracking Virtual Reality system for
   aircraft inspection training focused on improving aircraft inspection
   performance and ultimately aviation safety. The aesthetic appearance of
   the environment is driven by standard graphical techniques augmented by
   realistic texture maps of the physical environment. A ``virtual
   flashlight{''} is provided to simulate a tool used by inspectors. The
   user's gaze direction, as well as head position and orientation are
   tracked to allow recording of the user's gaze locations within the
   environment. These gaze locations, or scanpaths, are calculated as
   gaze/polygon intersections, enabling comparison of fixated points with
   stored locations of artificially generated defects located in the
   environment interior. Recorded scanpaths provide a means of comparison
   of the performance of experts to novices, thereby gauging the effects of

   useful to industry when the technical problems have been solved, and

   Furthermore, researchers must answer the important question of how AR
   might be integrated into the information technology infrastructure of a
   company. Tills paper describes as,. augmented reality demonstrator for
   the task of doorlock assembly in a car door. The demonstrator was
   developed as a practical, realistic application that could convey to a
   casual observer the concepts behind AR. A new, fast, and robust optical
   tracking algorithm was developed and integrated into a three-dimensional
   animation and rendering system, thereby creating a real-time fully
   three-dimensional HMD-based training application that teaches users how
   to assemble the doorlock into the door. The system was demonstrated to
   the general public at the Hanover Industrial Fair 1998: this
   demonstration of AR to a large, non-expert audience generated greater
   interest in this new area. There are still some technological problems
   to solve, but in order to get industrial partners interested in
   investing in this technology, researchers must make clear its possible
   benefits and its ability to be integrated into the whole company.}},

Title = {{Technological and information transfer: how do some nations learn what
   other nations know? Japan's experience}},
Journal = {{PACIFIC REVIEW}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{225-247}},
Abstract = {{The returns to the rapid acceleration in the growth of gross global
   product per capita in the past century and a quarter have been very
   inequitably distributed across nations. Nations that were already
   relatively wealthy in 1870 have received most of the benefits of this
   increase in material well-being. Japan is thus far the only major
   example of a country that has been able to fully traverse the vast gulf
   that separates poorer from wealthier nations Lately other economies in
   East Asia have experienced such sustained high rates of growth in gross
   domestic product per capita as to suggest they too will join Japan as
   non-Western examples of the world's wealthiest nations. Some doubt has
   been cast on these optimistic projections by findings that economies
   such as Taiwan and Korea have grown rapidly, seemingly Soviet-bloc
   style, without the benefit of rapid growth in total factor productivity
   change. Characterizing growth without total factor productivity change
   as Stalinist, however, is ahistorical. The United States, the United
   Kingdom and Japan among other nations, all experienced long periods of
   rapid growth in per capita GDP without simultaneously experiencing rapid
   increases in total factor productivity. In each instance, such phases
   were succeeded by periods where per capita GDP growth was increasingly
   augmented by improvements in total factor productivity.
   One puzzle here is that the periods characterized by little total factor
   productivity change do appear to be times when substantial technological
   improvement was taking place. In the case of the United States there is
   considerable evidence that the extraordinary increases in factor
   accumulation were driven by what appear to be substantial advances in
   technology. A case study presented for the cotton textile industry
   suggests much the same may have been true in Japan. The character of the
   product markets and the factor markets faced by the Japanese
   cotton-spinning industry in the Meiji period created an environment
   within which technological adaptation and innovation came to be a
   network phenomenon with the industry's trade association and the
   industry's prime machinery supplier serving as a critical link. Later
   with product market and credit market changes the role these
   institutions played diminished to be replaced by information transfers
   that were the byproduct of a very well-functioning market in
   experienced, and by the standards of other nations, very well-educated
   textile engineers.
   In the half-century after 1945, the rise of permanent employment
   practices in Japan has created barriers to information flows and
   collective technological innovation and adaptation that were so much a
   part of the experience of Japan's leading industry in the early
   twentieth century. Curiously, this is just the time when total factor
   productivity change has become an important component of Japan's very
   rapid growth in per capita GDP. The past half-century has also been a
   time when the Japanese government has been actively involved in
   attempting to shape industrial structure in an otherwise market-based
   economy. One set of policy instruments that have attracted particular
   attention overseas have been government-sponsored R\&D consortia. These
   consortia can be thought of as government programs designed to break
   down the walls preventing information hows among Japanese firms. Japan's
   cooperative R\&D projects can be thought of as ways to capture some of
   the benefits of American-style and pre-war Japanese-style labor markets,
   even while continuing to avoid some of the costs associated with
   relatively high labor mobility. There is great disagreement as to the
   efficacy of these Japanese government programs with overseas firms
   looking enviously at projects that Japanese industry sees as having only
   minor significance or worse. A study presented here of the impact of two
   Japanese government-sponsored optoelectronics projects on Japanese and
   American equity markets confirms these differing perceptions, confirms
   that the speed with which information diffuses back from Japan to the
   United States has increased substantially over the past decade, but does
   not suggest which of the two differing perceptions is correct.
   Knowledge-based growth may have proceeded this last half-century in
   Japan with less interfirm diffusion of technology than was
   characteristic at some points earlier in Japan's history.
   In the very late twentieth century, changes in global markets and the
   uncertainty of life close to the technological frontier are forcing
   changes in Japanese institutions. Japanese firms of the future may
   prefer to have their labor force bear more both of the risks associated
   with specialized training and the risks associated with secular and
   cyclical demand shocks. Much as Japan's labor force did early in the
   twentieth century, such steps will require a change in the way in which
   training is provided and changes in the Japanese government's
   educational and social policies. At the same time the type of
   information flow problems the government-sponsored R\&D consortia were
   once designed to address may well be as insignificant in the future as
   they once may have been in Japan's past. In contrast, the type of
   institutions supporting technological diffusion in Japan's textile
   industry in the 1920s and early 1930s may be part of Japan's future. On
   the basis of the evidence presented here, the answer to the question
