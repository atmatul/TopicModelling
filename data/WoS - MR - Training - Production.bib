Abstract = {{Motion capture acting is a challenging task, it requires trained and
   experienced actors who can highly rely on their acting and imagination
   skills to deliver believable performances. This is especially the case
   when preparation times are short and scenery needs to be imagined, as it
   is commonly the case for shoots in the gaming industry. To support
   actors in such cases, we developed a mixed reality application that
   allows showing digital scenery and triggering emotions while performing.
   In this paper we tested our hypothesis that a mixed reality head-mounted
   projection display can support motion capture acting through the help of
   experienced motion capture actors performing short acting scenes common
   for game productions. We evaluated our prototype with four motion
   capture actors and four motion capture experts. Both groups considered
   our application as helpful, especially as a rehearsal tool to prepare
   performances before capturing the motions in a studio. Actors and
   experts indicated that our application could reduce the time to prepare
   performances and supports the set up of physical acting scenery.}},

Title = {{Suffering at the borders of custom and science: Psycho-trauma in a

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Culture is produced by a field of data transmitted by
   custom, which set themselves up among those of scientific backgrounds,
   from scholar education. In Africa, due to historical reasons, academic
   and traditional educations are two different, parallel paths of learning
   taken by children. They are respectively secreted by two different
   sources: the tradition is locally produced whereas school education
   comes from the West. The process of understanding sickness requires
   attribution of meaning, the case of Mr B. exposes us the how and the why
   the African draws, strategically, in both production sources of his
   culture to attribute meaning to sickness.
   Results. - Mr B. grew up in the royal court, emblematic symbol of the
   pure tradition. Child in a village in the forest, he braved all
   difficult to access education. After high school, he worked as a teacher
   in his village before the insecurity forced him to leave and settle in a
   city, considered relatively secure and trading hub, 20 kilometers from
   his village. Having no access to the school where he taught, Mr B.
   decided to complete his studies downtown, in nursing. Finally graduated,
   he was hired by the Congolese organization of emergency management,
   Croix-Rouge du Congo, the Congolese national branch of the Red Cross
   International. As head of an aid worker team, Mr B. is led to deal with
   disasters, especially those produced by the exactions of armed groups
   given the current state of the security context in eastern DRC. In the
   middle of a mission, to intervene in a slaughter in which was killed
   thirty-eight people, a psychic trauma was triggered in him. Alongside
   the literary descriptions - learned in school and used every day for his
   patients - the reading of his own suffering is traditional first. Mr B.
   has managed to subtly carry his illness within an area where mix Western
   type treatment and traditional type. This disease was, in addition, an
   opportunity for rereading family ties, relationships between his - very
   demanding - work and his father's will. The king's witch doctor, the
   same who treated his father, provided the key, by his ritual to soothe
   family disputes. He also updated the meaning of symbols in order to
   establish individual and collective narrative identity, so that Mr B.'s
   work is no longer in conflict with his deceased father's will.
   Conclusion. - The value of this case lies in the reflection on modernity
   in the African health system to provide mediation between two
   intentionally made heterogeneous universes: the theories of some against
   realities of living of others. Caregiver training in DRC and Africa,
   while remaining scientist, would benefit from being closer to cultural
   practices to finally aspire to its note of nobility: producing
   caregivers for Africans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Title = {{A Stanislavskian Reading of Yoruba Trance on the Stage}},
Journal = {{STANISLAVSKI STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-30}},
Abstract = {{The article offers a contemporary study of the relationship between
   Stanislavski and Caribbean culture derived from a desire to incorporate
   traditions of African descent into world theater. It references studies
   on Stanislavski and ritual culture, as well as processes of play
   rehearsals and ritual ceremonies. These are essential research sources
   for trance-possession and its place in the actor's art and the
   psychophysical processes of the actor or dancer based on ancient Yoruba
   possession traditions. Studying performances during ritual experiences
   raises disturbing questions. How far can the interpreter get in touch
   with that reality? Much has been made of the external view of the
   importance of consciousness, but how about the impulses that lead the
   actor to deprogrammed areas of consciousness that access other
   communication levels? To propose a way forward, Maria Antonia (1964), by
   Cuban theater dramatist Eugenio Hernandez Espinosa, is explored. This
   production was created by mixing Yoruba tradition with the training of
   artists for whom Stanislavskian theatrical culture supplies a constant
   reference point.}},

Abstract = {{After a stroke, many survivors have impaired motor function. Robotic
   rehabilitation techniques have emerged to provide a repetitive,
   activity-based therapy at potentially lower cost than conventional
   methods. Many patients exhibit intrinsic resistance to hand extension in
   the form of spasticity and/or hypertonia. We have developed a therapy
   program using the Hand Exoskeleton Rehabilitation Robot (HEXORR) that is
   capable of compensating for tone to assist patients in opening the
   paretic hand. The system can move the user's hand, assist movement,
   allow free movement, or restrict movement to allow static force
   production. These options combine with an interactive virtual reality
   game to enhance user motivation. Four chronic stroke subjects received
   18 sessions of robot therapy as well as pre and post evaluation
   sessions. All subjects showed at least modest gains in active finger
   range of motion (ROM) measured in the robot, and all but one subject had
   gains in active thumb ROM. Most of these gains carried over to ROM gains
   outside of the robot. The clinical measures (Fugl-Meyer, Box-and-Blocks)
   showed clear improvements in two subjects and mixed results in two
   subjects. Overall, the robot therapy was well received by subjects and
   shows promising results. We conclude HEXORR therapy is best suited for
   patients with mild-moderate tone and at least minimal extension.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of Discrete Event Systems with 3D simulation and control
   technology to set up versatile virtual environments seems to be at the
   first glance a contradiction in terms because of mixing up two totally
   different application classes. But here, the newly developed State
   Oriented Modeling methodology comes into play providing a comprehensive
   and flexible object oriented framework for the development of complex
   Discrete Event Systems. State Oriented Modeling establishes a link
   between these two worlds using object oriented Petri Nets {[}10] for the
   discrete part as well as application specific mappings between
   continuous and discrete state variables realizing so called 3D Discrete
   Event Systems. Integrated in a versatile 3D simulation system, State
   Oriented Modeling allows for the efficient realization of a large class
   of applications within the large field of virtual environments. It
   provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use but nevertheless efficient
   framework for behavior modeling in virtual worlds and real-time
   simulation applications. When modeling virtual production lines for
   example, State Oriented Modeling provides an easy way for a
   close-to-reality simulation of automation systems starting with the
   control of simple actuators or sensors and ending with the supervisory
   control of the entire virtual factory. In the field of Projective
   Virtual Reality {[}4] State Oriented Modeling supervises the user's work
   in the virtual environment to derive his ``intention{''} and then
   generates appropriate command sequences for intelligent automation
   hardware. This way, even complex automation systems which may be far
   away or even in space can be controlled - and the user must not be an
   automation expert. In the field of interactive visualization and
   training environments State Oriented Modeling simulates a variety of
   dynamic objects in the virtual world, integrates interaction components
   like 2D control elements or application specific driver seats into the
   virtual environment and supervises training sessions to derive
   performance indicators. And, in addition to this, State Oriented
   Modeling is the basis for a new multi-agent and discrete event based
   approach to realize the virtual human.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last decade the competitive environment of manufacturing
   enterprises has changed considerably (Stalk and Hout, 1992). An initial
   emphasis on quality became the baseline from which to compete since high
   levels of quality quickly became taken for granted by customers, The
   focus of competitive attention then became those of reducing delivery
   lead time and improving delivery reliability (Bernard. 2004). In more
   recent years the provision of increasing levels of product choice and
   continuous reductions in costs have been added to the competitive mix.
   There is now increasing pressure on suppliers to provide higher levels
   of cost, quality and delivery performance in addition to ensuring the
   availability of a wider choice of products.
   An essential methodology, increasingly being adopted by manufacturing
   organisations, that is capable of assisting manufacturing organisations
   in fulfilling these competitive demands is that of lean production which
   has been shown to provide (Monden 1983, Womack, Jones and Roos 1990,
   Smeds 1990, Yusuf 2002) significant advantages in the critical areas of
   shortening lead times, improving delivery reliability, reducing costs,
   improving quality, and widening product mixes.
   Studies have shown that organisations making use of lean production
   techniques tend to have significant performance advantages over
   conventionally organised plants (Smeds 1990, Schonberger 1992. Chappell
   2002). There is also research that has reported the limitations of the
   lean philosophy, most notably Burgelman, (1993), who argues that
   environmental and social conditions have not been taken fully into
   consideration in explaining the use of lean production in Japan's
   competitive advantage. However, it is generally accepted that lean
   manufacturing practices have the ability to provide improvements in the
   majority of those areas considered critical to the competitiveness of an
   organisation.
   The paper will discuss a collaborative R\&D project which will
   accelerate the adoption and use of lean practices within a wide range of
   industrial and service sectors. A Virtual Discrete Event Process
   Simulation (V-DEPS) tool will be developed capable of providing a
   learning, training and decision support environment for lean
   practitioners from complete novices to experienced lean champions. Novel
   virtual process modelling, discrete event simulation, advanced
   visualisation and adaptive optimisation tools will be developed that
   enable self-organisation of improvement teams, and provide assistance
   with identifying \& prioritising problems, creative problem solving \&
   autonomous decision-making and lean solution optimisation \&
   implementation.}},
